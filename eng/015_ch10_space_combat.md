# CHAPTER 10: SPACE COMBAT

Space combat is a staple in classic science fiction, and the Cepheus
Engine has rules to cover it. This chapter details the basics for space
combat. These rules for vehicle and starship combat presented here are
designed to allow for more roleplaying and involvement of the
characters. Movement and maneuvering are abstracted to allow for
cinematic battles as vessels attempt to maneuver into a position of
pursuit and advantage against their opponents, or frantically try to
shake pursuit.

Range is similarly abstracted, needing only to note whether the range
for all vessels involved for each round is Close, Short, Medium, Long,
Very Long, or Extreme.

## Space Combat Checklist

Like personal combat, space combat in the Cepheus Engine is cyclical.
Everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle called a turn. Each turn in
space combat lasts one kilosecond. Generally, space combat runs in the
following way:

1.  The Referee determines the range at which the encounter begins.

2.  All crew members are assigned to a position on board their vessel.

3.  The Referee determines which characters are aware of their opponents
    at the start of the battle. If some but not all vessels are aware of
    their opponents, the vessels that are aware of their opponents are
    considered to get an automatic 12 on their initiative roll, giving
    them an Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM.

4.  Any remaining vessels roll initiative. All vessels are now ready to
    begin their first turn of combat.

5.  All vessels act in initiative order.

    1.  At the start of each combat turn, a Captain may declare that

        > their crew is acting hastily.

    2.  The crew members of the vessel resolve their actions.

    3.  After every crew member has completed their actions, any damage

        > is resolved if the vessel’s weapon systems hit enemy ships.

6.  When every vessel has had a turn, the combatant with the highest
    initiative total acts again, and Step 5 repeats until combat ends.

## Range in Space Combat

If two vessels randomly encounter each other while travelling through
the depths of space, far from any other objects or vessels, the
encounter will begin at Very Long range. More often, ships engage near a
planet, where the range is Short or Medium.

#### Table: Space Combat Range Bands

## Crew Positions

At the start of an engagement, all crew must be assigned to a position
on board ship. There can be only one pilot, but other than that, any
number of people can occupy the same position.

#### Table: Crew Positions

| Position               | Responsibility                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bay Gunner             | Each bay weapon has its own gunner.                                                                                |
| Captain                | Commands the ship, and can use Leadership and Tactics skills.                                                      |
| Chief Security Officer | Commands marines, and can use Leadership and Tactics skills in abstract boarding actions.                          |
| Damage Control         | A character assigned to free-floating damage control can repair any system.                                        |
| Drive Engineer         | An engineer can be assigned to each of the M-drive and the J-drive.                                                |
| Marine                 | Prepares to repel boarders, or to board enemy ships.                                                               |
| Passenger              | Passengers are all people aboard ship who are not assigned a position and are assumed to be waiting in staterooms. |
| Pilot                  | Flies the ship, responsible for changing course and for evasive maneuvers.                                         |
| Sensors Operator       | A character assigned to communications and sensors.                                                                |
| Turret Gunner          | Each turret has its own gunner. A character must choose which turret he is manning at the start of the combat.     |

### Automated Positions

The ship's computer can cover several positions if it is running the
appropriate software:

-   Fire Control programs can either act as **gunners** or aid existing

    > gunners.

-   A ship equipped with repair drones and Auto-Repair software acts as

    > **damage control**.

-   A ship running an Intellect program and Expert Pilot can be the

    > **pilot**.

-   A ship equipped with repair drones and running an Intellect program

    > and Expert Engineer can be a **drive engineer**.

## Initiative

Each ship in an engagement rolls 2D6 to determine their starting
Initiative score. The ship with a greater Thrust score gains a +1 DM to
its roll.

The Captain of each vessel (or each fleet, if more than one ship is
involved on each side) may a Tactics check. The Effect is added to the
Initiative of the vessel (or fleet).

## The Space Combat Turn

Each turn in space combat lasts around one kilosecond (1,000 seconds) of
game time. In a combat turn, vessels have individual Initiative. Actions
are taken in descending order of Initiative. If two vessels have the
same Initiative, the vessel with the highest Thrust goes first. If they
are still tied, then vessels act simultaneously. When a vessel acts, the
crew members of the vessel take all of their actions at once. Each crew
member gets a minor action and a significant action.

Once everyone has acted a combat turn is over and a new turn begins.
Initiative is not re-rolled but is dynamic, and may be adjusted up and
down by actions taken during a turn.

## Note on Personal Actions

As a space combat turn represents over 150 personal combat rounds, it
stands to reason that crew members may engage in a lot of personal
actions over the course of a single combat turn. Much of this is
abstracted into the various space combat actions. Most personal actions
have minimal impact on space combat. For crew members that do want to
pursue a personal action during space combat, such as use a psionic
ability, these actions count as minor actions on the space combat scale.
This glosses over the remainder of the character's time during the
combat turn, and highlights the primary acts that a character might want
to pursue without taking away from the rest of the space combat.

## Minor Actions

As in personal combat, minor actions are actions intended to perform
tasks that do not require significant focus and concentration. Each crew
member can take up to three minor actions per turn, at the loss of a
significant action.

### Adjust Speed

The pilot may increase or decrease the vessel's speed up to an amount
equal to its Thrust. This requires no skill check.

### Change Positions

Crew members changes crew positions, and are now considered to be
manning their new position rather than their previous one.

### Maintain Course

The pilot keeps the vessel on its current course and heading, remaining
at the current speed. This requires no skill check.

### Personal Action

A crew member may pursue any personal action that generally takes less
than a minute.

### Miscellaneous

The Referee may permit a character to perform a skill check or other
action as a minor action if the use of the skill does not require the
character's full attention or complex physical actions.

## Significant Actions

Significant actions are intended to do something within about 3 seconds.
You can perform a single significant action per turn, or forego it to
perform a total of three minor actions.

### Take Minor Actions

A character can take two minor actions instead of a significant action.

### Attack

A gunner may attack any target within the range of the weapon system
they are manning. The gunner attacks by making a Turret Weapons or Bay
Weapons skill check roll at a Difficulty determined by range, adding any
Computer Targeting, Sensor Targeting, or other modifiers in effect this
round for his vessel. The enemy ship may react by dodging, point defense
or triggering screens (see Reactions). A gunner may fire any or all of
the weapons in his turret or bay but each turret or bay may only fire
once per round. If the attack is successful it will inflict damage.
Damage is resolved after all attacks have been made in a vessel’s turn.
Missiles do not impact in the same round they are launched; their damage
is resolved in the combat turn that they impact their target.

### Avoid Collision

When a vessel is moving at Short or Close range through a debris field,
traffic, an asteroid belt, a planetary ring, or similar situation where
there is a reasonable chance of collision with another object, the pilot
must make an Avoid Collision check each turn. A collision inflicts 1D6
damage for every point of the vessel’s current speed.

#### Table: Collision Avoidance

| Situation                                              | Difficulty          |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Traffic (5 or more vessels within Short range), debris | Average (+0)        |
| Asteroid field, light density                          | Difficult (-2)      |
| Asteroid field, average density                        | Very Difficult (-4) |
| Asteroid field, heavy density                          | Formidable (-6)     |
| Significant speed difference between ship and debris   | DM -2               |

### Boarding Action

If two ships are Adjacent or docked, then a boarding action can be
attempted. If the ships are docked, then the attackers may cross over
safely via airlocks. If the ships are merely adjacent, then the
attackers must use thruster packs or small craft to cross over. While
crossing, the attackers may be attacked with point defense weapons or by
firing sand. Once across, boarding actions can be resolved using the
personal combat rules or the abstract boarding rules.

### Break Pursuit

If a vessel is being pursued (as per the Pursuit action) the pilot or
driver may break the pursuit with a successful opposed Pilot skill check
against his opponent. Once the pursuit has broken and the pursuing
vessel loses all accumulated attack bonuses against that target.

### Calculate Jump Plot

The navigator can hastily calculate a Jump Plot as a significant action
in space combat. Normally an Easy (+4) Education-based Navigation skill
check, hastening it to fit within one space combat turn imposes a DM-1
on the skill check.

### Dock with Another Vessel

The pilot must make a successful Average(+0) Pilot check. If the other
ship does not wish to be docked with then make opposed Pilot checks; the
ship trying to dock suffers a –2 DM. When docked, boarding actions can
take place.

### Coordinate Crew

The Captain makes an Average(+0) Leadership skill check. The Captain
gains a pool of points equal to the Effect of the skill check (minimum
of 1), which he can distribute to individual crew members as DMs
(granting a +1 DM per point) on skill or ability checks during the
combat turn.

### Electronic Warfare

A sensors operator may attempt to jam radio communications and sensor
locks by making an opposed Intelligence-based Comms check against the
sensors operator of the opposing vessel. Electronic warfare can be used
to break sensor locks.

Alternatively, electronic warfare can be used to attack smart missiles
that are targeting the ship. The sensors operator makes a Difficult (–2)
Comms check and, if successful, a single attacking smart missile ceases
attacking. The sensors operator may continue making checks to disable
smart missiles until he fails one, with a cumulative –1 DM each time.

### Evasive Manuevers

The pilot operates the vessel in an erratic manner in an attempt to
avoid being hit by opposing weapons fire. The Pilot makes an Average(+0)
Pilot skill. If successful, any attack rolls targeting the pilot's
vessel suffer a DM-1 penalty, or DM-2 with an Exceptional Success.

### Increase Initiative

The Captain of a vessel may make a Leadership check and increase the
Initiative of his vessel by the Effect of the check. This increase only
applies for the following turn.

### Intercept Enemy Communications

The sensors operator may attempt to intercept enemy communications. This
requires a Difficult(-2) Comms skill check. Encryption (if any) must
also be broken. Knowledge of enemy intentions can be valuable to a
Captain, if they know how to use it. The Captain may make an Easy (+4)
Tactics check to gain an advantage from intercepted communications. If
successful, the Captain gains knowledge of the enemy’s dispositions or
intentions. This translates to a one-time DM+4 bonus to any skill check
affecting the enemy (e.g. a pilot’s attempt to evade a sudden attack, or
a gunner’s precise shot just as the enemy vessel turns to present a
better target.) Of course, the enemy must have communications for them
to be intercepted.

### Line Up the Shot

A pilot may attempt to aid his gunners by providing a stable firing
platform along an optimum attack vector. The pilot makes a Pilot check
to aid his gunners, granting a DM+1 on all attacks rolls this turn with
a success, or a DM+2 with an Exceptional Success.

### Maintain Communications

The sensors operator can establish and maintain communications between
allied vessels with a Routine(+2) Comms skill check. If there is
significant interference or a lot of communications going on (e.g. due
to bad comm. discipline among a fleet), treat as Considerable Noise
(DM-2). Deliberate comms jamming requires an opposed Comms skill check
with the jammer. If reliable communications are not established, vessels
cannot act in concert, and Tactics skill cannot be applied.

### Pursuit

If a pilot makes a successful opposed Pilot skill check against another
vessel within Short or Close range travelling at the same speed as the
pilot's vessel, the successful pilot has placed his vessel in pursuit of
his target maintaining the current range and matching the target ship
move for move. Once a pursuit has been established, it must be
maintained each turn to take advantage of the position. Maintaining a
pursuit is a significant action that does not require a skill check. It
is automatically maintained unless the target succeeds at the Break
Pursuit action, manages to extend the range between the vessels to
Medium or greater, or succeeds in outpacing the speed of the pursuing
vessel by 7+ points. For each turn (after the first) that a vessel
maintains pursuit of another vessel, it gains a cumulative DM+1 to hit
when attacking the vessel being pursued, up to a maximum of DM+4.

### Ram

Ramming is a potentially suicidal maneuver in which a pilot
intentionally crashes his vessel into the hull of another vessel. This
action may only be attempted at Close range, and if the ramming vessel
is moving faster than the target. To successfully ram another vessel
requires an opposed Pilot skill check between both vessels. A collision
inflicts 1D6 damage for every point of difference in speed between the
two vessels.

### Range Check

The Navigator makes an opposed Navigation skill check with another
vessel. The vessel with the highest result may elect to increase,
decrease, or maintain the range between the vessels for the round.

### Reload Weapons System

A crew member (usually the gunner) may spend the round reloading one
spent missile rack, one spent sandcaster or other individual weapon
system.

### Repair Damaged System

A character on damage control may attempt to repair a damaged system by
making an Education-based Mechanics check. If the check is successful,
determine how many hits are repaired:

#### Table: Damage Repair Results

| Mechanics Check Effect | Hits Repaired |
|------------------------|---------------|
| 0                      | 1             |
| 1–5                    | 2             |
| 6+                     | 3             |

A ship with repair drones and the Auto-Repair software also makes one or
two repair checks on the vessel's turn (unless it is being used to
assist other repair attempts). The standard Auto-Repair software makes
the check with a +1 DM. These are battlefield repairs only and will
break down as soon as the battle is over unless repaired properly.

### Sensor Targeting

The sensors operator may attempt to spend the turn providing improved
fire control and targeting data to the gunners, hopefully increasing
their chances of hitting their targets. The sensors operator should make
a Education-based Comms skill check against the target's Sensor Jamming
rating, for each vessel that is to targeted. If successful, all gunners
on the vessel gain a DM+1 bonus to their attacks this turn, or a DM+2 on
an Exceptional Success. When using missiles the initial attack gets this
bonus – the individual missile to hit rolls do not benefit directly.
Smart missiles are unaffected.

### Miscellaneous

A character may make a skill check or do something else as a significant
action when such an action requires the character's full attention,
concentration, complicated physical actions or some combination thereof.
Any skill check with a time interval of 1-6 minutes is simply considered
a significant action during space combat.

## Reactions

As in Personal Combat, reactions are actions taken immediately in
response to the action of another. A ship may react to incoming attacks.
The following situations allow reactions:

-   Targeted by a beam attack

-   Incoming missile

-   Attempted boarding

The ship's Initiative determines how many times it may react in a round.

#### Table: Reactions By Initiative

| Initiative | Reactions |
|------------|-----------|
| 0–4        | 1         |
| 5–8        | 2         |
| 9–12       | 3         |
| 13+        | 4         |

### Dodge Incoming Fire

To dodge, the pilot must make a Pilot check. If successful, the attack
suffers a –2 DM.

### Fire Sand

Turrets equipped with sandcasters can fire sand at incoming beam
attacks. Each reaction spent on firing sand allows the gunner to make a
Turret Weapons roll. If successful the damage of each beam in the
incoming attack is reduced by 1D6. Resolve each beam separately. Each
firing of sand costs one canister of sand. Sand can also be directed
against incoming boarding parties. If the sand attack is successful,
each target in the boarding party takes 8D6 damage.

### Point Defense

Turret lasers can be used to destroy incoming missiles. The missiles can
only be destroyed in the moments before they strike the spacecraft as
they are too small and fast-moving to effectively target at greater
ranges. The gunner must make a Turret Weapons check against the missile.
If successful, the missile is destroyed. A gunner may keep making Turret
Weapons checks against missiles until he misses an attack; each attack
suffers a cumulative –1 penalty. Attacks may be directed against
different incoming missiles. Point defense can also be used to attack
incoming boarders in the same way.

### Trigger Screens

Screens can be activated as long as the commander or one of the gunners
has the Screens skill at Level 0 and the ship has the required screen
type (nuclear against nuclear missiles and fusion guns; meson against
meson guns). Screens reduce the damage from the attack by 2D6+the
operator's Screens skill. Nuclear dampers also remove the automatic
radiation hit from nuclear missile attacks.

## Other Actions

Other types of action can take place during space combat.

### Free Actions

Some actions are so fast on the scale of space combat that they do not
even qualify as a minor action. A character can perform as many of these
free actions as he likes in a turn, although if he performs several the
Referee may require him to spend a minor or even a significant action on
his various tasks.

### Extended Actions

Some skill checks will take longer than a single combat turn to
complete. Make a Timing roll for the task and then work out how many six
minute combat turns it will take to complete. A character engaging in an
extended action cannot do anything else but can abandon their action at
any time and return to the normal Initiative order. A character who is
hit by an attack while undertaking an extended action must make an 8+
roll using the skill in question with a negative DM equal to the amount
of damage the attack causes (after armor). Failure indicates that this
turn's work does not count towards the completion of the task. Failure
by six or more (an Exceptional Failure) ruins the task and the character
must start again.

### Delay

A vessel does not have to act when its turn comes up in the Initiative
order. The Captain may decide to act at any later point during the turn,
even interrupting another's actions to do so. When he acts, his
Initiative is set to the count on which he acted. If the character has
not acted by the end of the turn he may choose to act first in the next
turn, effectively giving up his actions in the previous turn in exchange
for an Initiative advantage. His new Initiative is set to one higher
than that of the current first person in the order. When multiple
characters are delaying and all wish to act first in the following turn,
their Initiatives are all set to the same score and they act in order of
Thrust as normal.

## Special Considerations

The following are special considerations in space combat.

### Abstract Boarding Rules

In circumstances when the Referee may wish to resolve a boarding action
without resorting to the personal combat rules, the following
alternative method is suggested. On each round of a boarding action, the
attacking Chief Security Officer (or Captain, if the CSO is down or not
appointed) makes an opposed Intelligence-based Tactics skill check
against the Chief Security Officer (or Captain, if the CSO is down or
not appointed) of the defenders. The results of each round depend on who
wins and the degree of success achieved by the winner of the opposed
check, as outlined in the Abstract Boarding Resolution table.

### Missiles

Unlike beam weapons, which travel at the speed of light and so hit the
enemy vessel almost instantly, missile weapons take time to cross the
gulf of space. Missiles travel at Thrust 10 towards their designated
target and their position can either be tracked as additional craft in
the battle or, for the sake of simplicity, they can be assumed to strike
after a number of turns dependent on launch range, as shown in the
Missile Launch Range table. Missiles cannot be used at Adjacent or Close
range.

#### Table: Missile Launch Range

| Range     | Turns to Impact |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Adjacent  | \-              |
| Close     | \-              |
| Short     | 1               |
| Medium    | 1               |
| Long      | 1               |
| Very Long | 2               |
| Distant   | 2               |

When the missile is launched, the gunner must make a Turret Weapons or
Bay Weapons skill check to determine the accuracy of the launch. The
effect of the skill check determines the chance that the missile will
strike its target when it hits. A target may react to incoming missiles
by dodging or point defense. This reaction does not take place until the
turn the missiles arrive at their destination, so any target response
must wait until then.

#### Table: Missile To-Hit By Skill Check Effect

| Turret Weapons/Bay Weapons check | Missile to-hit roll |     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|-----|
| Failed With Effect –6 or less    | 11+                 |     |
| Failed With Effect –1 to –5      | 10+                 |     |
| Succeeded With Effect 0          | 8+                  |     |
| Succeeded With Effect 1–5        | 7+                  |     |
| Succeeded With Effect 6+         | 6+                  |     |

#### 

#### 

#### Smart Missiles

The missile to-hit roll for smart missiles is always 8+ and if they miss
they make another attack every turn until they are destroyed with point
defense, jammed with ECM, run out of fuel or otherwise dissuaded.

### Planetary Maneuvers

Within close range of a planet, certain planetary maneuvers become
possible.

**Orbital Insertion**: The pilot may attempt to insert the ship into
orbit around a planet. In an orbital insertion fails, the ship fails to
enter the proper orbit, and the orbit will steadily begin to decay
drawing the ship towards the planet’s atmosphere in an uncontrolled
reentry (see Atmospheric Reentry below). This is a significant action
requiring a Routine(+2) Pilot skill check.

**Atmospheric Entry**: The pilot may attempt to transition the ship out
of orbit and into the atmosphere of a planet. This is a significant
action with an Average (+0) Pilot skill check, with any applicable DMs
from the Atmospheric Entry table. Exotic, Corrosive, or Insidious
atmospheres should be treated as Standard unless specified otherwise.

#### Table: Atmospheric Entry

| World Values                | DM           |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| World Size 9+               | -2           |
| World Size 4 or less        | +2           |
| World Atmosphere 1 or less  | Auto Success |
| World Atmosphere 2-5, 14(E) | +2           |
| World Atmosphere 8-9, 13(D) | -2           |

### Special Weapon Rules

Several types of weapons have their own rules.

-   **Meson Guns**: Meson guns ignore armor and always roll on the
    Internal Damage table. Furthermore, they also automatically inflict
    a radiation crew hit in addition to any other damage.

-   **Fusion Guns**: Fusion guns inflict a radiation crew hit in
    addition to any other damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a –DM
    equal to the ship's armor.

-   **Particle Beams**: Particle beams inflict a radiation crew hit in
    addition to any other damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a –DM
    equal to the ship's armor.

-   **Nuclear Missiles**: Nuclear missile hits inflict a radiation crew
    hit in addition to their normal damage. The bonus radiation hit
    suffers a –DM equal to the ship's armor.

-   **Sandcasters**: While the primary purpose of a sandcaster is to
    block incoming beam attacks, they can also be used as an attack. A
    sandcaster has a range of Close and inflicts 1 point of damage.

## Damage

Systems can take a variable number of hits before being destroyed,
depending on the system in question. A ship can endure one point of Hull
damage per fifty tons, rounding down. A ship that runs out of Hull
Damage will rapidly be incapacitated. A ship can endure one point of
Structure damage per fifty tons, rounding down to a minimum of one. A
ship that runs out of Structure breaks up and is completely destroyed.

The effects of damage are determined by subtracting the ship's armor
from the damage rolled by the weapon, then consulting the Space Combat
Damage table to determine the number of hits inflicted. Then roll on the
Space Combat Hit Location table for each hit. Small craft use the Small
craft column. Vessels of 100 tons or larger use the External Hit
(Vessel) column until a ship has suffered enough damage to wipe out its
Hull, and then uses the Internal Hit (Vessel) column. A double hit
applies two hits to the same location. A triple hit applies three hits
to the same location.

| 41–44                        | Two Triple Hits                    |
| For every extra three points | +1 Single Hit                      |
| For every extra six points   | +1 Double Hit                      |
