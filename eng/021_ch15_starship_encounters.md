# CHAPTER 15: STARSHIP ENCOUNTERS

Space is amazingly vast, and starships are incredibly small in
comparison. Aside from points where people tend to congregate, such as
within 100 diameters of inhabited planets or potential refueling
locations, the chances of encountering another vessel is small enough to
essentially occur only at the Referee's discretion. Random encounters
with intelligent beings in such areas are extremely unlikely, and
player-characters would be correct in assuming that such an encounter
was not a random occurrence. Referees are encouraged to simply use the
Astrogation Encounter Type table for random encounters under such
conditions, simply to avoid violating the players' suspension of
disbelief by providing generally non-starship encounters.

However, within those regions of interplanetary space where people
congregate, there's always a chance for a space encounter. As a general
rule of thumb, the Referee should check for space encounters when
entering or leaving such a region. Roll 1D6; on a 6, a space encounter
occurs. Referees may determine the type of space encounter based on the
events occurring within the game, or they may randomly determine the
type of encounter by rolling 2D6 and consulting the Space Encounters
table. Each entry on the Space Encounters table is supported by a
sub-table; the Referee can roll 1D6 and consult the sub-table for a more
specific example of a random encounter if needed.

Like any random encounter system, if a result doesn't make sense for the
current location in the game, then feel free to ignore it and roll
again, or better yet, choose a result that does make sense.

## Encounter Range

If two vessels randomly encounter each other while travelling in the
depths of interplanetary space, the encounter will begin at Very Long
range. More often, ships engage near a planet at Medium range. If the
characters do not succeed in a Comms check (as modified by any stealth
efforts made by the other vessel), then the encounter begins at one
range category closer (Long instead of Very Long, or Short instead of
Medium).

Most civilian vessels, as well as military vessels that are not
currently engaged in maneuvers, have transponders that operate as an
"Identification Friend or Foe" (IFF) system to differentiate friendly
from enemy spacecraft on sensors. When these are active, other vessels
gain a DM+4 on detection efforts. (It is generally against interstellar
law to operate a civilian vessel without such a transponder, but some
ship crews have been known to disconnect their transponders when
engaging in illicit activities.)

Some encounters, such as the starship encounter types, ignore the
general rules for range, and instead occur at a range determined by the
Referee.

## Space Encounter Descriptions

Most of the entries on the space encounter tables are self-explanatory.
However, some encounters have special rules that require further
explanation.

**Comet**: Dust and particles from the comet interfere with some
sensors, imposing a DM-2 on Comms skill checks while in the comet's
tail. An unusual object or vessel may be found at the heart of a comet,
but such occurrences are very rare and reaching such sites imposes a
risk of impact with space debris.

**Debris from collision or attack**, **Lost equipment or garbage**, and
**Micrometeorite storm**: The vessel is in danger of being impacted by
small objects with great force. The vessel suffers 1D6 damage for every
point of the vesselâ€™s Thrust rating, unless the pilot succeeds in a
Pilot skill check to avoid the debris.

**Interplanetary dust cloud**: Dust clouds interfere with some sensors,
imposing a -2 on Comms skill checks while in the cloud. The Referee may
impose a second space encounter within the cloud, or simply impose a
risk of impact with space debris.

**Jettisoned cargo pod**: For some reason, another vessel has jettisoned
its cargo into space, generally to protect the safety of its crew from
physical threats or legal actions. The contents of the pod can be
determined randomly as per the trade goods rules in **Chapter 7: Trade
and Commerce**, and often come with complications related to who dropped
it and why.

**Solar flares**: Solar flares release tremendous amounts of
electromagnetic energy (including harmful ultraviolet rays and X-rays),
as well as highly charged protons and electrons. Being caught in a solar
flare receives 1D6x100 rads every hour until the flares pass. See
**Chapter 11: Environments and Hazards** for details on handling
Radiation Exposure.
