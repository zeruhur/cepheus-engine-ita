# CHAPTER 7: TRADE AND COMMERCE

As outlined under **Starship Revenues** in **Chapter 6: Off-World
Travel**, a vessel can easily haul cargo for a flat rate, without having
to engage in speculative trading. However, for those merchants willing
to take the risk, speculative trading can prove to be a very profitable
enterprise. This chapter provides a simple speculative trade system for
use in Cepheus Engine campaigns, for those interested in such pursuits.

## Speculative Trade Checklist

Speculative trading follows a basic procedure. The following checklist
outlines the various steps in the speculative trade procedure.

1.  Find a supplier

2.  Determine goods available

3.  Determine purchase price

4.  Take goods to new world or market

5.  Find a buyer

6.  Determine sales price

## Find a Supplier

The first step in the process is simple: find a supplier with something
to sell. Characters can search for multiple suppliers, but there is a –1
DM per previous attempt on a planet in a given month.

*Finding a supplier*: Broker, Education or Social Standing, 1D6 days,
Average (+0).

*Finding a black market supplier*: (Illegal goods only) Streetwise,
Education or Social Standing, 1D6 days, Average (+0).

*Finding an online supplier*: (Worlds with TL 8+ only) Computers,
Education, 1D6 hours, Average (+0).

The size of the Starport provides a bonus to finding a supplier. Class A
starports give a +6 DM, class B starports give a +4 DM and class C
starports give a +2 DM.

## Determine Goods Available

Goods are divided into two categories of goods – Common and Trade Goods.
Common Goods can be purchased on any world. Trade Goods can usually only
be found on a world with a matching trade code. The amount of each type
of goods available is limited – the tons column on the Trade Goods table
determines how many tons of a given type of goods is available for
purchase.

A given supplier has all Common Goods available and 1D6 randomly
determined goods. Roll D66 on the table to determine the goods
available, ignoring results 61–65 unless dealing with a black market
supplier. If you roll the same type of goods multiple times, then the
supplier has extra amounts of those goods available.

Some goods are illegal, and can be purchased only through a black market
supplier. A black market supplier has whatever illegal goods match his
world’s trade code, as well as any randomly rolled illegal goods. Other
goods may be legal on some worlds, but not legal on others (such as
personal weapons and armor, which might be restricted on a world with a
high law level). The Referee should adjudicate such situations as they
occur.

**\*Note**: Unusual cargo covers unique or highly unusual items, such as
alien artifacts, high tech prototypes, stolen artwork of antiquity, or
unique lifeforms. Such items often form the seed for an adventure.

## Determine Purchase Price

Determining the purchase price for speculative cargo is based on the
results of a skill check. The results of this skill check represents the
best possible offer the parties can reach under the current conditions.

*Determining the purchase price*: Broker, Intelligence or Social
Standing, 1D6 kiloseconds, Average (+0).

The skill check is further modified by adding the largest Dice Modifier
that applies from the Purchase DM column, subtracting the largest Dice
Modifier that applies from the Sale DM column, and subtracting any Dice
Modifiers from the supplier (such as their Broker skill). Some
especially rich or powerful suppliers can demand high prices. In cases
where multiple Purchase or Sale DMs apply, use only the largest ones
from each column.

The Referee should then consult the Purchase column of the Modified
Price table, using the skill check result to determine the Purchase
Price percentage. The final price of the speculative cargo is the Base
Price multiplied by the Purchase Price percentage. The trader does not
have to accept this price, but if he rejects the deal, then he cannot
deal with that supplier again for at least one week. After that week, he
may attempt a new skill check to determine the purchase price for those
goods.

#### Table: Modified Price Table

| Result | Purchase | Sale |
|--------|----------|------|
| 2-     | 200%     | 40%  |
| 3      | 180%     | 50%  |
| 4      | 160%     | 60%  |
| 5      | 140%     | 70%  |
| 6      | 120%     | 80%  |
| 7      | 110%     | 90%  |
| 8      | 100%     | 100% |
| 9      | 90%      | 110% |
| 10     | 80%      | 120% |
| 11     | 70%      | 140% |
| 12     | 60%      | 160% |
| 13     | 50%      | 180% |
| 14     | 40%      | 200% |
| 15     | 30%      | 300% |
| 16+    | 20%      | 400% |

### Local Brokers

A speculative trader can hire a local broker to represent him in trade
negotiations. This allows the merchant to use the broker’s skill levels
instead of their own, although that comes at a price in the form of a
percentage of the final negotiated price, which must be paid even if the
merchant decides not to sell his goods. The Local Broker table indicates
the commission charged for a given skill level, as well as indicating
what maximum skill levels are commonly available for a given class of
starport.

#### 

#### Table: Local Brokers

| Skill Level | Commission | Notes                         |
|-------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| 1           | 5%         | Max for Class D or E Starport |
| 2           | 10%        | Max for Class C Starport      |
| 3           | 15%        | Max for Class B Starport      |
| 4           | 20%        | Max for Class A Starport      |

## Selling Goods

Selling goods works just like purchasing goods, with the following
changes:

A character must find a buyer, instead of a supplier. The same rules
apply.

When selling goods, add the largest Sale DMs for the world trade code
and subtract the largest Purchase DMs.

If a character does not accept the price offered for his goods, he must
find another buyer or wait a week, in which case he may attempt a new
skill check to determine the selling price.
