# CHAPTER 13: PLANETARY WILDERNESS ENCOUNTERS

Characters in the uncivilized areas on the planet’s surface quickly find
out that they are not alone. So long as a world can support life, animal
encounters and other natural events are common, regardless of the
current terrain. This chapter discusses various encounters that can
occur in the wilderness on a planet’s surface.

## Animal Encounters

Animals in any ecological system interact with each other, forming food
chains, obeying instincts, defending territory, and generally living out
their lives. When people enter such an ecological system, they will
encounter the animals of the system, prompting natural reactions, such
as attack or flight.

Although the precise nature of animals may change, and they may prove
quite alien to ordinary experience, most will conform to the broad
classifications given below. A Referee may choose to establish his own
ecological system on a specific world, ignoring the encounter system
outlined here. This system, however, is intended to allow broad latitude
in both animal types and attack/defense mechanisms, while remaining
essentially logical and reasonable.

**Animal Types**: Nearly all animals may be classified into four basic
categories: herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, and scavenger. Specific
definitions for these terms are provided in a later section of these
rules, and differ from the precise scientific definitions in current
use. Within each category, a variety of animal types exist, based on
specific feeding/hunting habits; examples of this concept are grazers,
chasers, and pouncers.

Animals which are encountered may be further classified into various
categories and types, and specific attack and defense mechanisms
determined. The resulting description indicates the actions an animal
will take without resorting to such confining labels as bear or tiger.
While a Referee may well elect to use such names, this system also
allows the players freedom to encounter truly alien beasts as well.

### Animals and Characteristics

Animals have a similar range of characteristics to humans, but there are
several differences:

**Instinct**: Instinct is the animal equivalent of Education. Animals
apply their Instinct DM to tasks such as sensing prey or solving
problems.

**Pack**: Pack is the animal equivalent of Social Standing. The higher a
creature’s Pack score, the larger the group that it is associated with,
and the more standing the creature has in that group.

### Planetary Themes

A world's ecology can be extremely diverse. However, the Referee may
elect to implement specific themes on a planetary basis, to create
consistency and flavor in presentation. Distinctive features help make
each world stand out to the players as unique experiences. These could
range from basic symmetry to reproductive methods (and the associated
genders), from the number of limb pairs to the common sensory organs.
The implementation of a planetary theme lies at the discretion of the
Referee.

### Step One: Choose a Terrain

Terrain has an impact on the type of animals one might encounter. Giant
aquatic creatures are not found in forests, after all, nor are feathered
flying creatures found flying at the bottom of the ocean. The first step
in the rules for creating animals in the Cepheus Engine is to choose the
creature’s terrain, as terrain can have a significant impact on an
animal’s statistics.

The Terrain DM Chart details modifiers for animal subtypes and sizes, In
addition, the result of 1D6 determines the basic movement for a given
creature (A for Amphibious, F for Flight, S for Swimming, and W for
Walking). Some movement codes have a number after them; these are an
additional Size DM for the animal.

#### Table: Terrain DM Chart

| Terrain              | Subtype DM | Size DM | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    |

| Deep ocean           | +4         | +2      | S +8 | S +6 | S +4 | S +2 | S    | S –2 |

### Step Two: Determine the Animal’s Type and Subtype

The Referee should then determine the animal’s type and subtype. If the
Referee is building up an encounter table, the animal’s type is obvious:
the type necessary to fill in this entry on the encounter table.
Otherwise, the Referee must choose an appropriate type: Carnivore,
Herbivore, Omnivore or Scavenger. The Referee might also roll on the 1D6
Animal Encounter Table Template to randomly choose an animal type.

Once the animal type has been determined, the Referee rolls 2D6, and add
in the terrain’s Subtype DM. After that, the Referee consults the
Subtype by Animal Type table under the column of the animal’s type to
determine the animal’s subtype.

#### Table: Subtype by Animal Type

| 2D6        | Herbivore    | Omnivore | Carnivore | Scavenger     |
|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 or less  | Filter       | Gatherer | Pouncer   | Carrion-Eater |
| 2          | Filter       | Eater    | Siren     | Reducer       |
| 3          | Intermittent | Gatherer | Pouncer   | Hijacker      |
| 4          | Intermittent | Eater    | Killer    | Carrion-Eater |
| 5          | Intermittent | Gatherer | Trapper   | Intimidator   |
| 6          | Intermittent | Hunter   | Pouncer   | Reducer       |
| 7          | Grazer       | Hunter   | Chaser    | Carrion-Eater |
| 8          | Grazer       | Hunter   | Chaser    | Reducer       |
| 9          | Grazer       | Gatherer | Chaser    | Hijacker      |
| 10         | Grazer       | Eater    | Killer    | Intimidator   |
| 11         | Grazer       | Hunter   | Chaser    | Reducer       |
| 12         | Grazer       | Gatherer | Siren     | Hijacker      |
| 13 or more | Grazer       | Gatherer | Chaser    | Intimidator   |

### Step Three: Note Modifiers and Skills by Subtype

Terran creatures that exemplify these specific subtypes are noted in
brackets after the name. The Referee should make note of the
characteristic modifiers and skills that are noted after the description
– the exact level of skills varies depending on the particular creature.

**Carrion-Eater** (vulture): Scavengers which wait for all other threats
to disperse before beginning. Carrion-eaters have Recon. Instinct +2.

**Chaser** (wolf): Animals which kill their prey by attacking and
exhausting it after a chase. Chasers have Athletics. Dexterity +4,
Instinct +2, Pack +2.

**Eater** (army ant): Eaters will eat anything they encounter, including
characters. Endurance +4. Pack +2.

**Filter** (earthworm): Herbivores which pass their environment through
their bodies are termed filters. Unlike grazers, which move to food,
filters move a flow of matter through themselves and filter out the
food. Endurance +4.

**Gatherer** (raccoon, chimpanzee): Gatherers are herbivores that
collect and store food. Gatherers have Recon. Pack +2.

**Grazer** (antelope): Grazers move from food source to food source,
often in large packs. Their primary form of defense tends to be fleeing
danger. Instinct +2, Pack +4.

**Hijacker** (lion): Scavengers which steal the kills of others through
brute force or weight of numbers are hijackers. Strength +2, Pack +2.

**Hunter** (baboon): Opportunistic predators that stalk easy prey.
Hunters have Survival. Instinct +2.

**Intermittent** (elephant): Herbivores that do not devote their entire
time to searching for food. Intermittents have Pack +4.

**Intimidator** (coyote): Scavengers which establish their claim to food
by frightening or intimidating other creatures.

**Killer** (shark): Carnivores that possess a raw killing instinct,
attacking in a frenzied manner. Killers have Natural Weapons and either
Strength or Dexterity +4, Instinct +4, Pack –2.

**Pouncer** (cat): Pouncers kill by stalking and ambushing their prey.
Pouncers have Recon and Athletics. Dexterity +4, Instinct +4.

**Reducer** (vermin): Reducers are scavengers that act constantly on all
available food, devouring even the remains left by other scavengers.
Pack +4

**Siren** (venus fly-trap): Sirens create a lure to attract prey.
Usually, this lure will be specific to the species the siren preys on,
but some rare lures are universal. Pack –4.

**Trapper** (spider): An animal which allows its prey to enter a trap.
Generally, any creature surprised by a trapper is caught in its trap.
Pack –2.

### Step Four: Determine Animal Size and Characteristics

For each creature, roll 2D6 for its Size and apply any Size DMs based on
terrain and movement. The creature’s Size determines its Weight,
Strength, Dexterity and Endurance – for example, a roll of 7 means that
the creature has a mass of 100kg, a Strength score of 3D6, a Dexterity
score of 3D6 and an Endurance of 3D6.

Intelligence for most animals is 0 or 1. Roll 2D6+DMs for the animal’s
Instinct and Pack. To determine the number appearing value, consult the
Number Appearing by Pack Characteristic Score table.

All animals have at least Athletics 0, Recon 0, and Survival 0, and most
will have 1D6 ranks split among these skills, Natural Weapons, and any
skills listed in their behavior.

#### Table: Animal Size

| 2D6       | Weight (kg) | Strength | Dexterity | Endurance |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 or less | 1           | 1        | 1D6       | 1         |
| 2         | 3           | 2        | 1D6       | 2         |
| 3         | 6           | 1D6      | 2D6       | 1D6       |
| 4         | 12          | 1D6      | 2D6       | 1D6       |
| 5         | 25          | 2D6      | 3D6       | 2D6       |
| 6         | 50          | 2D6      | 4D6       | 2D6       |
| 7         | 100         | 3D6      | 3D6       | 3D6       |
| 8         | 200         | 3D6      | 3D6       | 3D6       |
| 9         | 400         | 4D6      | 2D6       | 4D6       |
| 10        | 800         | 4D6      | 2D6       | 4D6       |
| 11        | 1,600       | 5D6      | 2D6       | 5D6       |
| 12        | 3,200       | 5D6      | 1D6       | 5D6       |
| 13        | 5,000       | 6D6      | 1D6       | 6D6       |
| 14        | 10,000      | 6D6      | 1D6       | 6D6       |
| 15        | 15,000      | 7D6      | 1D6       | 7D6       |
| 16        | 20,000      | 7D6      | 1D6       | 7D6       |

| 19        | 35,000      | 9D6      | 1D6       | 9D6       |
| 20+       | 40,000      | 9D6      | 1D6       | 9D6       |

#### Table: Number Appearing by Pack Characteristic Score

| Pack  | Number Appearing |
|-------|------------------|
| 0     | 1                |
| 1–2   | 1D3              |
| 3–5   | 1D6              |
| 6–8   | 2D6              |
| 9–11  | 3D6              |
| 12–14 | 4D6              |
| 15+   | 5D6              |

### Step Five: Determine Animal’s Weapons, Armor and Base Speed

Roll 2D6 separately for the animal’s Weapons and Armor.

**Weapons**: When generating weapons, roll 2D6 and consult the Animal
Weapons table. Add a +8 DM if the animal is a Carnivore, and a +4 if it
is an Omnivore; subtract a –6 DM if the animal is a Herbivore.
Scavengers automatically have Teeth in addition to any other weapons. If
a number is present after the Weapons type, then add that number to the
number of damage dice the creature rolls. Damage from attacks depends on
the creature’s Strength score, as shown in the Damage by Strength table.

**Armor**: When generating an animal’s armor, roll 2D6-7, and add the
animal’s Size result (the die roll result that determined the animal’s
size, not the actual weight of the animal.) Add a +4 DM when rolling for
armor if the animal is a Herbivore, and a +2 if it is an Scavenger;
apply a –2 DM if the animal is a Carnivore. Also, Flyers suffer a –2 DM
when determining armor. Consult the Animal Armor table for the animal’s
armor rating.

**Base Speed**: An animal’s base speed is determined by generating a
Speed Multiplier, as per the Animal Speed Multiplier by Subtype table,
and multiplying that by 6, which is the average speed of a human in
meters per minor action. If an Animal Speed Multiplier value falls below
the value found in the Minimum Speed column, round it up to the Minimum
Speed value.

## Universal Animal Format

The following format is used to represent animal’s basic game statistics
in the Cepheus Engine rules.

\[Animal Name; optional\]

\[Size\]kg \[Subtype\] (\[Type\]), \[Terrain\] \[Locomotion\], \[Animal
UPP, replacing Education with Instinct and Social Standing with Pack\],
\#App: \[Number Appearing\]

\[Animal Skill List, in alphabetical order, with skill levels listed
after skill names\]

\[Animal weapons\]; \[Animal armor\]; Speed: \[Speed\]m

\[Animal Description; optional\]

For example, this creature could represent a tough little flying alien
pest that loves to shred things and eat them:

6kg Eater (Omnivore), Hill Flyer, 6A5168, \#App: 2d6

Athletics-0, Melee(Natural Weapons)-1, Recon-1, Survival-2

Claws (2d6); Hide (1); Speed: 6m

## Animals in Combat

Unless otherwise noted, animals operate just like characters in combat.
The range category of an animal’s weapons can be found in the Animal
Weapon Ranges table.

#### Table: Animal Weapon Ranges

| Weapon     | Range                  |
|------------|------------------------|
| Claws      | melee (extended reach) |
| Hooves     | melee (extended reach) |
| Horns      | melee (extended reach) |
| Projectile | ranged (thrown)        |
| Stinger    | melee (close quarters) |
| Teeth      | melee (close quarters) |
| Thrasher   | melee (close quarters) |

## Creating Encounter Tables

The system for creating animals in the Cepheus Engine rules can be used
to generate creatures on the fly. However, the system works best when
the Referee prepares an encounter table for each terrain likely to be
encountered. This not only gives the Referee statistics for wilderness
adventuring, but also provided a large amount of potential background
data for expanding the world within the universe the Referee has
created.

To create an encounter table, first the Referee should select a table
format. Although an encounter table can be in whatever format the
Referee desires, the two formats most commonly used are represented in
these rules as the 1D6 Animal Encounter Table Template and the 2D6
Animal Encounter Table Template. Note that the Templates only provide an
animal's type (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore or scavenger), and in the
case of the 2D6 table, event.

Each entry should be generated in turn. When an encounter table
indicates that an event will occur, the Referee should create an event
appropriate to the world and terrain. An event may be almost anything,
including a natural disaster or seismic event, an interesting terrain
feature or curiosity, unusual flora or weather. The Hills Terrain
Encounter Table is an example of a completed encounter table.

#### 1D6 Animal Encounter Table Template

## Using the Encounter Tables

Each day an adventuring band may possibly have one or more encounters
with some animal life forms. As a general rule, the Referee will check
for an encounter once while the band is travelling and once while the
band is halted (for rest, exercise, encampment, or whatever). There is a
one-third chance (5+ on 1D6) that an animal encounter will occur in any
of the specified terrain types. The Referee may choose to modify this
frequency depending on planetary or local conditions.

In addition, specific encounters at specific locations are always
possible. For example, the Referee may already have populated a location
(perhaps a ruin) with specific animals. These are not subject to normal
random encounter rules.

By their lifeless nature, vacuum worlds (and any other world without
life) tend to have encounter tables comprised primarily of events. On an
airless world, events could include silt pools that operate like
quicksand, magnetic anomalies, solar flares, or possibly tracks left by
previous explorers.

## Animal Reactions in Encounters

When characters disturb an animal or otherwise draw attention to
themselves while within its territory roll 2D6 and consult the Animal
Reactions by Subtype table. If the result on the table is neither attack
nor flee, then the animal stands still until provoked again, in which
case roll again.
