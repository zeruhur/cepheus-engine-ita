# CHAPTER 6: OFF-WORLD TRAVEL

Characters in science fiction don't live in a single village on a single
planet all their lives. Instead, their stories often take them out of a
planet-bound existence and out into the stars. Adventurers in Cepheus
Engine games are no different. They will travel to different worlds,
seeking out new, exciting and hopefully profitable activities to pursue.
Therefore, it is important to develop an understanding of off-world
travel. Off-world travel can take one of two different forms,
interplanetary travel through normal space and interstellar travel
through Jump space. This chapter explores both facets.

## Interplanetary Travel

All ship operations, including interstellar flights, involve some
sublight maneuvering. Ships making short interplanetary flights usually
accelerate halfway there, then reverse thrust and decelerate the rest of
the way. The Common Travel Times by Acceleration table offers rounded
values for common travel times.

For Referees desiring more accuracy in their numbers, use the formula:

**T=2** $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathbf{D}}{\\mathbf{A}}}$ where **T** is time
in seconds, **D** is distance in meters, and **A** is acceleration in
m/sec<sup>2</sup>

## Interstellar Travel

Interstellar flights require the use of Jump drive. Jump is also often
used for long-distance flights within a solar system, where the
real-space transit time would be greater than the 1-week Jump time. A
ship can only safely Jump when it is more than one hundred diameters
distant from any object. Gravity can cause a Jump bubble to collapse
prematurely, bringing a ship back into normal space early. To enter
Jump, a vessel needs a properly aligned hull Jump grid, a suitable set
of course vectors (called a Jump Plot), and a working and properly
fueled Jump drive.

The Jump grid allows the Jump field to properly form around the ship and
protect it from Jump space. A damaged or misaligned grid can cause a
ship to misjump, or to suffer Jump Intrusions while in Jump space. In
the worst-case scenario, a ship with a damaged drive or a distorted grid
may be destroyed at entry or breakout.

A Jump Plot is also required. A Jump Plot can be created by a navigator
using the ship’s computer. In addition, all Class-D and better starports
can provide pre-calculated jump plots for any populated worlds within
jump range for Cr1,000 per jump number. Each jump course tape provides
the jump plot necessary to perform a jump from one specific world to a
specific destination, and become increasingly less reliable as they get
older.

Creating a Jump Plot is an Easy (+4) Education-based Navigation skill
check taking 1D6 kiloseconds, modified by the Jump distance (thus, a
Jump–4 gives a –4 DM to the check). If the check is failed, then the
navigator must plot the Jump again, or the starship suffers a misjump. A
Jump cannot be made until the navigation calculations are complete. Jump
Plots can be created in advance, but quickly become out of date.

When the ship is ready to Jump, the engineer must properly divert power
to the Jump drive. Firing the Jump drive is an Average (+0)
Education-based Engineer check taking 10–60 seconds. The Effect of this
check aids the Jump Success roll.

All normal Jumps take roughly one week (148+6D6 hours), and are subject
to random variations in the point of emergence. The older a plot is, the
more variance there is in the actual Jump performance. Thus course tapes
tend to err on the side of caution, and give emergence points a long way
out from the destination world.

A Jump carries the vessel a number of parsecs equal to the Jump number.
Jumps of less than one parsec (less than three light years, or one hex)
are possible, and count as Jump–1 for the purposes of navigation and
fuel expenditure.

### Jump Success Roll

Roll 2D6 and add the following DMs. If the result is 0 or less, the ship
misjumps. If the result is 8+ the Jump is accurate. Any other result is
an inaccurate Jump. If a Jump was made using a bad Jump Plot, the ship
automatically misjumps.

\+ the Effect of the divert power Engineer check

–1 per month that the Jump Plot is out of date (such as when using older
Jump course tapes)

–2 per Jump drive hit

–2 for using Unrefined fuel

–8 if still within the hundred-diameter limit at the time of Jump

### Jump Failures and Misjumps

When a starship suffers an inaccurate Jump, the vessel emerges from Jump
in the wrong part of the target star system, requiring 1D6 days travel
through normal space. When a starship misjumps, the ship ends up 1D6x1D6
parsecs in a random direction.

In both cases, the emergence is extremely hard. The vessel takes the
equivalent of a critical hit from the discordant transition. In
addition, everyone aboard the vessel suffers severe headaches, nausea
and even nosebleeds for several hours before and after the ship emerges
from Jump space.

## Starship Operations

Standard procedures exist to govern how a starship goes about its
business and handles emergency situations. Under normal circumstances, a
ship will not deviate from these procedures. A captain whose vessel
ignores standard operating procedure will usually have to explain
himself to a patrol vessel or the local port authority.

### Ship’s Passage

A ship must provide sufficient accommodation for its crew; normally this
means one stateroom per two crewmembers (this is termed
double-occupancy). Any remaining stateroom space may be used to carry
passengers. Passengers cannot share accommodation with crew, with the
exception of working passage. Normally, one passenger per small
stateroom and two per large stateroom room can be carried.

Passenger travel can be classified into five overarching categories –
high, middle, low, working and stowaway.

**High Passage**: The best method of travel is called high passage,
which involves first class accommodations and cuisine. High passengers
have the services of the ship's steward, entertainment and complete
attention to their comfort. There is a baggage allowance of up to 1,000
kilograms. High passage costs Cr10,000 and provides food and lodging for
1 person for a distance of 1 jump. Double occupancy is allowed at a
discounted rate of Cr16,000 (Cr8000 per passenger). Each level of
Steward skill (including level 0) allows the steward to effectively look
after two high passage passengers on board a ship (so a character with
Steward 2 could care for six passengers).

**Middle Passage**: In order for starships to fill their staterooms with
passengers, middle passage is offered on a standby basis, in the event
that not enough high passages are sold. While middle passengers occupy
staterooms normally similar to those occupied by high passengers, they
do not receive the service or entertainment accorded the higher paying
passengers. In addition, the quality of the cuisine is rather low.
Baggage totaling 100 kilograms is allowed. A middle passenger may be
'bumped' and the stateroom taken by a late arriving high passenger; the
middle passenger's ticket is returned, but no other compensation is
made. (The middle could then buy a high passage and 'bump' another
middle passenger, if the extra cost seemed worth it. Middle passage
costs Cr8,000 and provides food and lodging for 1 person for a distance
of 1 jump. Double occupancy is allowed at a discounted rate of Cr13,000
(Cr6500 per passenger). Each level of the Steward skill (including level
0) allows the steward to care for five middle passengers.

**Low Passage**: Transportation while in cold sleep (suspended
animation) is possible at relatively low cost to the passenger. The
passenger is placed in a low passage berth before the ship takes off,
and travels the entire journey in a state of suspended animation. He
does not age, and requires very little life support. Unfortunately, the
low passage system involves some intrinsic dangers to the passenger, and
he runs some risk of not surviving the voyage. Therefore a qualified
medic should always be in attendance when reviving passengers from low
berths. When a passenger is revived from cold sleep, they must make an
Easy (+4) Endurance check; failure means that the passenger dies during
revival. If a medic is present, the medic may assist the passenger with
an Education-based Routine (+2) Medicine skill check, as per the Aid
Another rules. Low passage costs Cr1,000 and includes a 10 kg baggage
allowance; many commercial cryoberth units have a built-in baggage
compartment.

**Working Passage**: A starship captain with a crew shortage may hire an
individual to fill the vacant position, paying not money but passage in
return. Working passage may not continue for more than three jumps, or
the individual is considered to have been hired for standard salary. In
order to be hired for working passage, the individual must have some
expertise in the position for which he is hired. Baggage totaling 1,000
kilograms is allowed.

**Stowaway**: A stowaway is a person who secretly boards a vessel in
order to travel without paying and without being detected. Unnoticed by
the captain, crew, port officials and customs authorities, stowaways may
gain access to a vessel with or without the assistance of port
personnel. Once on board the ship, stowaways often hide in empty
containers, cargo holds, maintenance shafts, crawl spaces, storage
rooms, engine rooms, unused staterooms, and behind false panels.
Stowaways risk imprisonment or heavy fines if caught, as it is
considered a crime in most jurisdictions. If caught at the destination
world, stowaways may be deported. Should this occur, the travel costs
for the stowaway's return to the previous world visited, per the ship's
logs, can become the obligation of the ship's owner or captain. Because
of this, most commanders do not take kindly to any stowaways they
discover aboard their vessels, and have been known to space them.

### Standard Operating Procedures

Most commercial starships follow a simple schedule, spending one week in
Jump space and one week in normal space, taking care of business. Once a
ship emerges from Jump space, it travels to the destination world, where
passengers disembark, old cargo is unloaded and new cargo replaces it,
the crew performs routine ship maintenance and refueling, new passengers
come aboard the vessel, and then the starship travels to a Jump point in
preparation for entering Jump space and traveling to the ship’s next
destination.

Non-commercial starships typically follow a similar schedule. Without
the obligations of passengers or cargo, however, these vessels can
choose to travel much faster. The week in-system can be reduced to
simply refueling by the quickest means possible and then making the next
Jump.

When a vessel first emerges from Jump space, the first course of action
is to scan normal space for potential dangers. Once the commander
determines that the vessel is safe, the navigator then determines the
ship's location in normal Space and plots a course to the ship's
destination in-system.

The commander may want to skim a local gas giant for free fuel. If so,
the pilot achieves orbit and skims the "surface" of the gas giant for
fuel. Scooping a gas giant for fuel takes 1D6 hours per 40 tons of fuel.
When the fuel tanks are full, the pilot can then take the ship back out
to a Jump point to leave for the next system, or travel to another
destination in-system, such as a local world.

If the commander wishes to visit a local world, such as the mainworld,
the pilot follows a course laid out by the navigator to the destination.
After arriving at the world, the pilot achieves orbit and then proceeds
to either the orbital starport or surface starport. Once docked at the
starport, the vessel unloads any high passengers, followed by mail,
middle passengers, cargo and finally low passengers. The ship refuels,
if needed, and renews its life support. If the ship’s owner or captain
is interested in speculative trading, they then sell off speculative
cargo and buy new cargo to replace it, if they find any good deals. In
addition, the commander or purser addresses all ship's business,
including paying the ship expenses.

While on planet, crew members may explore local areas of interest, hire
new crew to fill any available positions, and even take on the
occasional odd job.

When the commander determines it is time to depart, cargo handlers load
all cargo into the vessel. Low passengers are then put into cryoberths.
High passengers are then escorted to their staterooms, followed by mid
passengers, if any staterooms remain available. Finally, vessels with a
mail contract load up on outgoing mail. Income is collected and placed
into the ship's accounts.

After getting clearance from starport control, the pilot takes the ship
into orbit. The navigator then plots a course through normal space to a
Jump point. As the pilot takes the vessel to the Jump point, the
navigator works out the Jump plot. Once at the Jump point, the engineer
diverts power to the Jump drive, and the ship enters Jump space.

Along the way, the vessel may encounter other ships. Gas giants are
often used by pirates to attack unsuspecting vehicles, so system defense
boats are prevalent in the region. Patrol vessels may hail a ship as it
travels to and from the Jump point. Port authorities may perform a
customs inspection before allowing a ship to dock at the starport. Other
ships, civilian and military, commercial and non-commercial, may be
travelling in and out of the system.

## Starship Expenses

The primary expenses for a starship are the ship’s mortgage or debts,
crew salaries, fuel, life support, port fees and routine maintenance.

### Mortgage or Debts

If the crew is paying off debts on their spacecraft, then these debts
must be paid each month. The standard terms for a ship mortgage are
paying 1/240th of the cash price each month for 480 months (40 years).
In effect, interest and bank financing cost a simple 120% of the final
cost of the ship, and the total financed price equals 220% of the cash
purchase price. Ship shares are treated as reducing the cash price of
the ship, and so reduce the monthly cash payments.

### Crew Salaries

All starships and space vessels need a crew of some kind. Small craft
like shuttles normally just have a pilot (and usually a copilot). Larger
ships, and especially those using Jump drive to travel between the
stars, need a larger crew. At a minimum, a starship will need:

**Pilot**: A qualified Pilot to maneuver the ship. A Pilot makes Cr6,000
per month.

**Navigator**: Someone to create Jump Plots and navigate the ship. On
small ships, this job is often doubled up with the Pilot’s duties. A
Navigator makes Cr5,000 per month.

**Engineer**: Someone to maintain the ship and operate the drives.
Larger ships may need several engineers and technicians to back them up.
A Chief Engineer makes Cr4,000 per month.

Other crew positions exist:

**Master**: A vessel’s Master, or Captain, is responsible for the vessel
and the safety of everyone aboard. A Merchant who receives the Starship
benefit at mustering-out will hold this position. Aboard a small ship,
he will usually have another job, such as Pilot or Navigator. The pay
due to a ship’s Master can vary. Assume a standard of Cr6,000 per month,
or the salary of highest-paid job he is qualified to do. Many merchant
ship owners take a cut of the ship’s profits instead of a salary.

**Medic**: Ships that carry passengers must have a qualified medic. All
vessels should have some form of medical assistance available. A medic
makes Cr2,000 a month.

**Purser**: Commercial ships often employ someone to look after the
accounts and supplies. This is the purser’s job. It is often doubled-up
with other duties. A purser is often paid a cut of the ship’s profits
rather than a salary; a standard salary would be Cr3,000 per month.

**Gunner**: Armed ships must employ gunners to operate the weapons.
Salary is Cr1,000 per month.

**Assistant Engineers and Technicians**: Technically adept people can
assist the Engineer in maintaining the ship and operating her drives.
Salary is Cr1000 per month.

**Cargo Handlers, Deck Hands and Security**: Some ships employ personnel
to carry out these duties. While not essential to the operation of the
ship, these people are useful to have around. Salary is Cr1000 per
month.

**Stewards**: While anyone can be assigned to look after the passengers
and cook everyone’s meals, professional stewards are useful in ensuring
the passengers enjoy their trip, and thus that the ship stays in
business. Salary is Cr3,000 per month.

The basic living expenses of crewmembers during their shipboard duties
are considered paid out of the ship’s overheads. Note that salaries are
generalized and can vary considerably depending upon circumstances and
special arrangements.

#### Table: Crew Salaries

| Position         | Monthly Salary    |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Ship's Master    | Varies            |
| Ship's Purser    | Varies or Cr3,000 |
| Pilot            | Cr6,000           |
| Navigator        | Cr5,000           |
| Engineer         | Cr4,000           |
| Steward          | Cr3,000           |
| Medic            | Cr2,000           |
| Gunner           | Cr1,000           |
| Other Crewmember | Cr1,000           |

### Fuel

Refined fuel may be purchased at any class A or B starport for Cr500 per
ton delivered at the starport. If fuel must be ferried out to a ship,
add Cr100 per ton to the cost. Refined fuel may also be obtained by
running unrefined fuel through a Fuel Purification System installed
onboard a ship. Refined fuel decreases the chance of a problem occurring
with a ship's power plant, maneuver drive, and Jump drive.

Unrefined fuel is available for Cr100 per ton from any class A, B, or C
starport delivered at the starport. If fuel must be ferried out to a
ship, add Cr100 per ton to the cost. Unrefined fuel is also available
for free from the following sources:

**Water**: On worlds with a hydrographic rating of 1 or higher, a ship
may land near an open body of water or ice and pump fuel into their fuel
tanks for free. Using water as fuel in this manner is considered to be
running unrefined fuel. Note that many worlds may not allow ships to
land and fuel for free, preferring to control the availability of fuel
from the starport only, thus earning the revenue from the operation.

**Gas Giants**: Streamlined ships equipped with fuel scoops may dive
into the upper atmosphere of a gas giant and fill their tanks with
unrefined hydrogen. Larger ships may use streamlined fuel shuttles to
ferry fuel loads back to the main ship as needed to refill the tanks.
Scooping takes 1D6 hours per 40 tons of fuel. There are no fees
associated with 'skimming' a gas giant for fuel, but these are also
often the favorite point of attack for pirates. Fuel skimmed from a gas
giant is considered to be unrefined.

### Life Support

Each stateroom on a ship costs Cr2,000 per month, occupied or not. This
cost covers supplies for the life support system as well as food and
water, although meals at this level will be rather spartan. Each low
passage berth costs Cr100 per month.

A spacecraft with power can sustain life support for one person per
stateroom for one month comfortably, and for six months at a stretch
(number of staterooms × 5,000 person/hours). Without power, this drops
to two weeks at most.

Life support supplies can be purchased in bulk. One ton of life support
supplies will provide 20 passengers or crew with life support for one
month, at a cost of Cr54,000. One ton of luxury life support supplies
costs Cr72,000, and covers the same number of people for the same amount
of time.

### Port Fees

It typically costs Cr100 to berth for 6 days in a starport, and Cr100 a
day thereafter.

### Routine Maintenance

A ship needs maintenance, which costs 0.1% (1/1000th) of the total cost
of the ship per year and requires a shipyard. Maintenance should be
carried out each month. If maintenance is skipped or skimped on, roll
2D6 each month, with a +DM equal to the number of months skipped. On an
8+, the ship takes damage to a random system. Roll on the System
Degradation table for the number of hits. Repair supplies cost
Cr10,000/ton.

#### Table: System Degradation

| Roll | Number of Hits |
|------|----------------|
| 1–3  | 1              |
| 4–5  | 2              |
| 6    | 3              |

## Starship Revenue

Starships generate revenue by carrying passengers, cargo, mail and
charters. Goods taken on in orbit are delivered when placed in orbit
around the destination. Goods taken on a planetary surface are
considered to be delivered when off-loaded on the surface of the
destination world. This custom applies to cargo, passengers, and mail.

#### Table: Available Freight And Passengers

| Starport Class | Freight (tons) | High Passengers | Mid Passengers | Low Passengers |

### Bulk Cargo

Ships will commonly pay their way by transporting cargo in bulk. This is
on a flat-fee basis per ton of cargo. A ship's accounts are credited
with Cr1,000 per ton of cargo, upon delivery. For any given destination
world, roll on the Available Freight and Passengers table to find out
how many tons of freight are available. A ship may choose to remain in
port and see if new cargoes present themselves; roll again every 3 days.
If desired, players may determine how much freight there is for every
destination, and then choose where to go based upon profitability. The
number of passengers must be determined at the same time as cargo; if a
ship remains in port waiting for freight, passengers will find another
ship, and vice versa.

A ship without the capacity to carry all the available freight or
passengers can take some of what is available, up to its total capacity.

### Passengers

For any given destination world, roll on the Available Freight and
Passengers table to find out how many passengers are available. A ship
may choose to remain in port and see if new passengers present
themselves; roll again every 3 days. If desired, players may determine
how many passengers there are for every destination, and then choose
where to go based upon profitability. The number of passengers must be
determined at the same time as cargo; if a ship remains in port waiting
for more passengers, freight could be shipped out on another ship, and
vice versa.

### Mail and Incidentals

Merchant ships may receive mail delivery contracts, usually as an
adjunct to their established routes. Five tons of ship cargo capacity
must be committed to postal duty on a full time basis, the ship must be
armed, and a gunner must be a part of the crew. The starship is paid
Cr25,000 (Cr5,000 per ton of postal cargo area) for each trip made,
regardless of the actual mail tonnage carried. Such tonnage will not
exceed 5 tons per trip. Roll 1D6-1 for the number of actual tons of
mail, though the ship receives the Cr25,000 fee whether there is
anything to carry, or not.

Other ships may be approached to deliver private messages, at times
through the ship's owner or captain, and at times clandestinely through
a crew member. Private mail is usually intended for delivery to a
specific point (such as an Explorer’s Society resort, or to a bar owner
in the starport), and is generally accompanied by a Cr20 to Cr120
honorarium. The Referee should decide if a private message to is
awaiting transmittal, and determine randomly which crew member is
approached to carry it. Serving as a carrier for private mail also
serves as an introduction to the recipient as a dependable, trustworthy
person.

### Charters

Vessels are often chartered by commercial or private concerns. The
reasons vary: private transport, standby cargo capacity for a priority
load, special or "discreet" deliveries, etc. The standard price to
charter a non-starship is Cr1 per ton per hour, usually with a
twelve-hour minimum. Charter price for a starship is computed based on
its capacity. Starships are chartered in 2-week blocks; the charge is
Cr900 per ton of cargo hold plus Cr9,000 per high passage berth and
Cr900 per low passage berth. The owner pays all overhead and supplies a
crew.

### Speculative Trading

A trader with cargo space available and free capital with which to
speculate may seek out suitable goods to buy and sell. A complete Trade
and Commerce system is presented in **Chapter 7: Trade and Commerce**.

## Miscellaneous Topics

The following topics relate to aspects of starship operations that might
impact an adventurer’s experience over the course of a Cepheus Engine
adventure or campaign.

### Airlocks

A ship has at least one airlock per 100 tons. The average airlock is
large enough for three people in vacc suits to pass through at the same
time. An airlock takes ten seconds to cycle. Under normal circumstances,
airlocks are locked down from the bridge and require a Very Difficult
(–4) Engineer (electronics) check to override. An unlocked airlock can
be triggered from outside. Airlocks generally have vacc suits, rescue
bubbles and cutlasses in a ship’s locker nearby.

Ships with cargo space have cargo hatches, allowing up to 10% of their
cargo to be transferred at any time.

### Distress Signals

A distress signal indicates that a person or group of people, vessel,
small craft, or other vehicle is threatened by grave and imminent danger
and requests immediate assistance. The use of distress signals under
other circumstances is against most system and interstellar laws; in
fact, most jurisdictions have large penalties for false, unwarranted or
prank distress signals. Given the vastness of interplanetary space, help
is hard to come by. Therefore, most interstellar and interplanetary
governments mandate that the commander or master of any vessel that
detects a distress signal is legally obligated to either respond and
offer assistance or contact the authorities to report the signal.

Some pirates have been known to use false distress signals to lure other
vessels into a trap. This behavior has created significant mistrust of
distress signals among civilian starship commanders, but interstellar
law still requires that assistance be rendered if authorities cannot be
reached within a reasonable time period. In the event that the commander
of a vessel is unable or unwilling to respond to such a call, they are
required by law to officially log their reason for not doing so into the
ship's logs. Such commanders can be held accountable for their decision,
and can pay a fine on some worlds that could exceed Cr1,000,000 (or
MCr1), as well as serve time in prison.

### Docking

Two spacecraft may dock if they are close together and neither ship
attempts to resist the docking maneuver. Many airlock designs across
charted space are compatible; for incompatible airlocks, ships extend
flexible plastic docking tubes that adapt to the target airlock. Docking
with another vessel is a Routine (+2) Pilot task taking 1–6 minutes. If
one ship is drifting or unpowered, the difficulty rises to Difficult
(–2).

### Boarding

Hostile boarding actions are safest when the enemy ship is crippled, in
which case it is a standard docking procedure. If the enemy ship is
still moving, then the prospective boarders must match the target’s
velocity and dock with it (a Difficult (–2) Pilot task), or else just
land on the hull and either make their way to an airlock or cut through
from outside.

### Landing

Any ship with a standard or streamlined hull may land on the surface.
Unstreamlined ships suffer a –2 DM to any Pilot checks made in
atmosphere while a ship with a Distributed hull suffers a –4 DM to any
Pilot checks, and is likely to take severe structural damage if it
lands. Landing at a starport is a Routine (+2) task for most ships
taking 10–60 seconds.

Most ships have landing gear, allowing them to touch down ‘in the wild’,
which requires an Average (+0), Difficult (–2) or even Very Difficult
(–4) check, depending on local conditions. Non-distributed ships can
also land on bodies of water without sinking. Failing a landing roll
means that the ship has landed improperly or even crashed.

## Ship Security

The primary goal of a starship's or vessel's security measures is to
protect the safety of the ship and crew. Particularly on frontier worlds
and lawless backwater planets, starships are at risk to a number of
factors, including hijackers, piracy, sabotage, subversion and
terrorism. Ship security exists on multiple levels to prevent this from
happening. These can be grouped broadly into the categories of physical
security and cybersecurity.

### Physical Security Systems

Physical security systems for vessels are generally intended to deter
potential intruders (e.g. warning signs); detect intrusions and
monitor/record intruders (e.g. intruder alarms and internal monitoring);
and trigger appropriate incident responses (e.g. by security personnel
or the ship's crew in general). Numerous systems have proven useful.

Physical barriers such as airlocks act as the outermost layer of
security. They serve to prevent, or at least delay, attacks, and also
act as a psychological deterrent by making intrusions difficult. Even
within the ship, bulkheads and panels can be locked to limit or slow
access. The means of authorization for different locking systems is
captured in the Restricted Access Security table. It should be noted
that the ship's computer can open or close any non-mechanical lock
remotely, as well as report on a door's status.

Ship security systems can detect intrusion detection through a variety
of means. Cameras, accessible to any authorized personnel, monitor
public areas. Internal sensors such as motion detectors in key traffic
areas and life support detectors (for unexpected changes in oxygen
levels) provide additional methods of detecting intrusion.

#### Table: Restricted Access Security

| Type            | TL  | Means of Access                                | Override Skill | External Door       | Internal Door       |
|-----------------|-----|------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Biometrics      | 8   | DNA test, palm print, retinal scan, voiceprint | Electronics    | Formidable (-6)     | Very Difficult (-4) |
| Electronic Lock | 7   | Keycard or combination                         | Electronics    | Very Difficult (-4) | Difficult (-2)      |
| Intelligent     | 9   | Granted by ship's computer                     | Electronics    | Formidable (-6)     | Very Difficult (-4) |
| Mechanical Lock | 4   | Key or combination                             | Mechanics      | Difficult (-2)      | Average (+0)        |

### Cybersecurity

The security of a ship's computer is only as good as the Security
software that's been installed. All starships come with Security/0
installed, but a wise ship's owner will invest in more advanced security
programs, whenever possible. Most vessels run Security/2 programs, at a
minimum. The Cybersecurity Tasks table outlines the difficulties of
certain tasks that might be attempted by hijackers and pirates. All
tasks require the Computer skill.

#### Table: Cybersecurity Tasks

| Task                                | Typical Difficulty                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Access ship records                 | Average (+0)                                                        |
| Grant crew authorization to someone | Difficult (-2)                                                      |
| Override key systems                | Formidable (-6)                                                     |
| Override security systems           | Defined by Security software package, typically Very Difficult (-4) |

### Security Measures

Security measures on board a starship activate when an intrusion or
emergency has been detected. These measures include internal alarms,
artificial gravity control, tranq gas and the venting of atmosphere.

**Internal Alarms**: If an alarm is tripped (hull breach, fire, door
being forced open, alarm button pressed) it will alert the crew. The
location of the alarm will be shown on computer displays. The average
passenger ship has several crew trained in combat; military ships will
carry marines. Some vessels will even have security robots who respond
automatically to alarms.

**Artificial Gravity Control**: It is possible to alter the artificial
gravity on board. Reducing gravity to zero will limit actions to the
level of a character’s Zero-G skill. Gravity can also safely be
increased up to 3G.

**Tranq Gas**: Some ships carry tranq gas canisters in the air vents,
which can be released automatically. These flood a compartment with gas
that forces an Endurance check each round, with a –1 DM per previous
check. Any character who fails the Endurance check is knocked
unconscious.

**Venting Atmosphere**: If a compartment is connected to an airlock,
then the air can be vented from that area. Characters in that area must
make a Strength check to hang on and will also begin to suffocate.
Internal doors on a ship are airtight, so portions of the ship can be
selectively vented, dependent on the ship's floor plan and the relative
positions of airlocks.

## Planetary Travel on Other Worlds

On-planet, and in civilized areas, regular services may be available for
a few credits, allowing characters to ride to their destination aboard
anything from a rickshaw to a maglev bullet train. In the course of
their adventures, characters may ride aboard steam ships, dirigibles,
submersibles, grav speeders or atop living mounts. Costs are fairly
negligible for such travel. Assume a basic cost of 1D6X5 Credits per day
of travel.

If the characters wish to use a vehicle of their own, this cost is not
necessary. However, a suitable vehicle must be available.

## Characters and the Law

In each of the situations listed in the Potential Law Enforcement
Encounters table, roll 2D6 and add the listed modifiers. If the total is
lower than the planet's Law Level, the characters are investigated or
challenged by agents of planetary law enforcement.

#### Table: Potential Law Enforcement Encounters

| Situation                                                   | DM  | Response    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-------------|
| First approach to a planet                                  | +0  | Check       |
| Offworlders wandering the streets of a city (once per day)  | +0  | Check       |
| Offworlders acting suspiciously                             | –1  | Check       |
| Bar fight                                                   | –1  | Combat      |
| Shots fired                                                 | –2  | Combat      |
| Breaking and entering                                       | –2  | Investigate |
| Firefight involving armored characters and military weapons | –4  | Combat      |
| Murder and carnage                                          | –4  | Investigate |

Check means that the characters' travel documents and identities are
checked, either by a police officer or guard, or electronically by
querying the characters' comms. A successful Admin or Streetwise roll
can allay suspicion, but if this check is failed, the planetary
authorities move on to Investigate.

Investigate means that a detective or bureaucrat probes deeper into the
characters' backgrounds. If the characters have a ship, it will be
searched. They may be followed, or have their communications tapped.
They may also be questioned closely.

Finally, Combat means that the police show up ready for a fight. Their
response will generally be proportional to the threat posed by the
player characters; if the characters are just making trouble in a bar,
then most police forces will just use batons, tranq gas and other
non-lethal weapons. On the other hand, if the characters are in Battle
Dress and firing PGMPs at the palace of the planetary governor, then the
police will show up with the best weapons and armor available at the
planet's TL (or even a few levels higher).

### Arrests and Sentencing

Characters arrested for a crime will face punishment, determined by
rolling 2D6+DMs on the Sentencing table. For crimes involving smuggling
banned goods, the DM is equal to the difference between the planet's Law
Level and the banned goods in question. Other crimes have a set DM, per
the Sentencing Modifiers by Crime table.

#### Table: Sentencing Modifiers by Crime

| Crime                   | DM           |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Assault                 | Law Level –5 |
| Destruction of Property | Law Level –3 |
| False Identity          | Law Level –2 |
| Manslaughter            | Law Level –1 |
| Murder                  | Law Level +0 |

A character with the Advocate skill may attempt to reduce the severity
of sentencing by making a check. If successful, reduce the Sentencing DM
by the Effect of the check.

#### Table: Sentencing

| Result    | Sentence                                                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 or less | Dismissed or trivial punishment                                    |
| 1–2       | Fine of 1D6x1,000 Credits                                          |
| 3–4       | Fine of 2D6x5,000 Credits                                          |
| 5–6       | Exile or a fine of 2D6x10,000 Credits                              |
| 7–8       | Imprisonment for 1D6 months or exile or fine of 2D6x20,000 Credits |
| 9–10      | Imprisonment for 1D6 years or exile                                |
| 11–12     | Imprisonment for 2D6 years or exile                                |
| 13–14     | Life imprisonment                                                  |
| 15+       | Death                                                              |

A result of Exile means that the character must leave the planet
immediately and never return. Fines for smuggling goods are per ton of
goods seized – gun running can be an extremely risky proposition.
