# CHAPTER 4: EQUIPMENT

The following section lists examples of common equipment that
adventurers may want. Aside from armor and weapons, each listing notes
the object's name and a basic description. The technological level
indicates local technology required to manufacture something with the
capabilities listed. Price and weight are for an item manufactured by an
interstellar society of tech level 10-15; items produced at lower tech
levels will probably be bulkier and more expensive. An item with no
weight or size given can be carried or worn without difficulty.
Additional lines of explanation are given where considered necessary.

## Technology Level Overview

Technology Level, also known as Tech Level or TL, is a measure of the
scientific and production capacity of a world and the complexity and
effectiveness of a piece of equipment.

#### Table: Technology Level Overview

| TL     | Descriptor      | Notable Characteristics                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | Primitive       | No technology.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 1      | Primitive       | Roughly on a par with Bronze or Iron age technology.                                                                                                                            |
| 2      | Primitive       | Renaissance technology.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3      | Primitive       | Mass production allows for product standardization, bringing the germ of industrial revolution and steam power.                                                                 |
| 4      | Industrial      | Transition to industrial revolution is complete, bringing plastics, radio and other such inventions.                                                                            |
| 5      | Industrial      | Widespread electrification, tele-communications and internal combustion.                                                                                                        |
| 6      | Industrial      | Development of fission power and more advanced computing.                                                                                                                       |
| 7      | Pre-Stellar     | Can reach orbit reliably and has telecommunications satellites.                                                                                                                 |
| 8      | Pre-Stellar     | Possible to reach other worlds in the same system, although terraforming or full colonization is not within the culture’s capacity.                                             |
| 9      | Pre-Stellar     | Development of gravity manipulation, which makes space travel vastly safer and faster; first steps into Jump Drive technology.                                                  |
| 10 (A) | Early Stellar   | With the advent of Jump, nearby systems are opened up.                                                                                                                          |
| 11 (B) | Early Stellar   | The first primitive (non-creative) artificial intelligences become possible in the form of “low autonomous” interfaces, as computers begin to model synaptic networks.          |
| 12 (C) | Average Stellar | Weather control revolutionizes terraforming and agriculture.                                                                                                                    |
| 13 (D) | Average Stellar | The battle dress appears on the battlefield in response to the new weapons. “High autonomous” interfaces allow computers to become self-actuating and self-teaching.            |
| 14 (E) | Average Stellar | Fusion weapons become man-portable.                                                                                                                                             |
| 15 (F) | High Stellar    | Black globe generators suggest a new direction for defensive technologies, while the development of synthetic anagathics means that the human lifespan is now vastly increased. |

Higher Technology Levels exist and may appear in some Cepheus Engine
universes.

## Currency

The Credit (Cr) is the standard unit of currency in Cepheus Engine.
Larger denominations include the KiloCredit (KCr; 1,000 Credits) and the
MegaCredit (MCr; 1,000,000 Credits).

## Armor

Armor reduces the amount of damage a character takes from a hit, based
on the type of armor worn. The armor rating for a set of armor is equal
to the amount of damage reduced by the armor when you are hit in combat.
A hit with Effect 6+ always inflicts at least one point of damage,
regardless of the target’s armor.

Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armor can be worn at a time.
Resolve damage from the outside in – damage that gets through the outer
layer of armor is next applied to the inner layer.

**TL**: The earliest tech level at which this item first becomes
available.

**Armor Rating (AR)**: The amount of damage reduced by the armor when an
attack strikes the character. When two values are listed separated by a
slash, the number to the left of the slash represents the armor rating
against all attacks except lasers, while the number to the right of the
slash represents the armor rating against laser attacks.

**Cost**: The cost of the item in Credits (Cr).

**Weight**: The weight of the item in kilograms.

**Skill Required**: Some armors have a required skill. A character
suffers the usual unskilled penalty when using armor without levels in
the required skill.

#### Table: Common Personal Armor

| Armor                 | TL  | AR    | Cost      | Wgt  | Skill Required |
|-----------------------|-----|-------|-----------|------|----------------|
| Ablat                 | 9   | 3/8\* | Cr75      | 2kg  | --             |

### Armor Descriptions

**Ablat** (TL 9): A cheap alternative to Reflec, ablat armor is made
from a material that ablates (vaporizes) when hit by laser fire. Each
laser hit on ablat reduces its armor value (versus lasers) by one, but
the armor is cheap and easily replaceable.

**Battle Dress** (TL 13): The ultimate personal armor, battle dress is a
powered form of combat armor. The servomotors vastly increase the user's
speed and strength, boosting his Strength and Dexterity by +4 while
wearing the armor. Damage to the wearer's characteristics is calculated
as normal, but the values from the armor are used for all other purposes
such as hand to hand damage or skill checks. The suit has a built-in
Model 2 computer running an Expert Tactics-2 program to give tactical
advice and updates and is commonly outfitted with numerous upgrades. The
suit is fully enclosed, with a six-hour air supply and gives full
protection against environmental hazards – including NBC shielding – as
if it was an HEV suit.

**Cloth** (TL 7): A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic cloth.
The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the body, which can
result in bruising. However, cloth armor is highly useful and versatile
– it can be effectively concealed under normal clothing although
observers making an Investigate or Recon check at 8+ will notice
something unusual.

**Combat Armor** (TL 11): This full-body suit is used by the military
and not generally available on the open market, although those with
military or criminal contacts can obtain it without much difficulty. It
is issued to troop units and mercenary battalions. Combat armor protects
from hard vacuum in the same way as a vacc suit and provides life
support for six hours.

**Hostile Environment Vacc Suit** (TL 8): Hostile environment suits are
designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient,
such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases,
extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer
serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere.
HEV suits provide all the life support offered by a normal vacc suit
(for six hours) but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation
such as that found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing radiation exposure
by 180 rads), and high pressure environments like undersea trenches.

**Jack** (TL 1): A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body suit
covering the torso and upper arms and legs.

**Mesh** (TL 6): A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or
plastic mesh that gives it added protection against bullets.

**Reflec** (TL 10): Reflec armor is a flexible plastic suit with layers
of reflective material and heat-dispersing gel. It is highly effective
against lasers, but provides no protection against other attacks. Reflec
can be worn with other armor.

**Vacc Suit** (TL 8): The vacc suit or space suit is the spacer's best
friend, providing life support and protection when in space. A vacc suit
provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of
temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum
(decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads), for six hours.

## Communicators

Characters separated by physical location often have a need to maintain
communications. These examples of communications equipment fulfill that
need. Routine use of these devices does not require a skill check. When
attempting to overcome interference or use these devices for other
purposes, the Comms skill check is used.

#### Table: Communications Equipment

| Communicator              | TL  | Cost  | Wgt    | Range   |
|---------------------------|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| Long Range Communicator   | 6   | Cr500 | 15 kg  | 500 km  |
| Medium Range Communicator | 5   | Cr200 | 10 kg  | 30 km   |
| Short Range Communicator  | 5   | Cr100 | 5 kg   | 10 km   |
| Personal Communicator     | 8   | Cr250 | 0.3 kg | Special |

**Long Range Communicator**: Back-pack mounted radio capable of ranges
up to 500 km and contact with ships in orbit. Ten separate channels. At
tech level 7 reduce the weight to 1.5 kg and it becomes belt or sling
mounted.

**Medium Range Communicator**: Belt-mounted or sling carried radio set
capable of up to 30 km range, and contact with official radio channels.
Five separate channels. At tech level 7, reduce the weight to 500 grams.

**Short Range Communicator**: Belt-mounted radio capable of 10 km range
(much shorter underground or underwater). Three separate channels. At
tech level 7 reduce the weight to 300 grams and it becomes hand-held.

**Personal Communicator**: A hand-held, single channel communication
device. On world with a tech level of 8 or higher a personal
communicator is able to tap into the world's satellite communication
network and with the proper address, contact any other communicator in
the world (for a fee). The channel is private, but not secure and may be
monitored on some worlds. Usually network access can be arranged at the
local starport for a small fee. On worlds with a tech level of 7 or
less, personal communicators will not work.

## Computers

The power of a computer is given by its rating (Model 1, Model 2 and so
forth), which measures the complexity of the programs it can run.
(Storage space is effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above.) Programs are
rated by the computer rating they require. A system can run a number of
programs up to its rating.

The computers listed here are laptop size. Battery life is two hours at
TL 7, eight hours at TL 8, and effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above.
Desktop computers offer a slightly greater amount of processing power
for the same cost but not enough to make a difference in-game. Desktops
become obsolete during TL 8.

#### Table: Computers by TL

| Optimum TL | Computer Power | Mass (kg) | Cost (Cr) |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| TL 7       | Model 0        | 10        | 50        |
| TL 8       | Model 1        | 5         | 100       |
| TL 9       | Model 1        | 5         | 250       |
| TL 10      | Model 2        | 1         | 350       |
| TL 11      | Model 2        | 1         | 500       |
| TL 12      | Model 3        | 0.5       | 1,000     |
| TL 13      | Model 4        | 0.5       | 1,500     |
| TL 14      | Model 5        | 0.5       | 5,000     |

**Computer Terminal** (TL 7): This is a ‘dumb terminal’, with only
limited processing power. It serves as an interface to a more powerful
computer such as a ship’s computer or planetary network. Terminals range
in size depending on their control method – a holographic display
terminal can be much smaller than one with a physical keyboard and
screen. A computer terminal has Model 0, and costs Cr200.

**Hand Computer** (TL 7): A hand computer is a portable computer system
with considerable processing power. It is more powerful than a computer
terminal, and can be used without access to a network. A hand computer
costs twice as much as a normal computer of the same TL but can he held
in one hand and operated with the other.

### Computer Options

**Data Display/Recorder** (TL 13): This headpiece worn over one or both
eyes provides a continuous heads-up display for the user, allowing him
to view computer data from any linked system. Because of the transparent
screen vision is not obscured while using a DD/R headset. DD/Rs can
display data from any system, not just computers – they can display vacc
suit oxygen reserves, grav belt status, neural activity scanner results
and so forth. Cr5,000.

**Data Wafer** (TL 10): The principle medium of information storage is
the standard data wafer, a rectangle of hardened plastic about the size
of a credit card. A TL 10 data wafer is memory diamond, with information
encoded in structures of carbon atoms; more advanced wafers use more
exotic means of data storage. Cr5.

**Specialized Computer**: A computer can be designed for a specific
purpose, which gives it a Rating of 1 or 2 higher for that program only.
The navigation computer on a starship might be only a Model 1, but it
could run the Expert Navigation/3 program because it is specially
designed for that task. A specialized computer costs 25% more per added
Rating. In addition, when working out how many programs the computer can
run simultaneously, the program that the computer is specialized for
does not count against that total.

### Computer Software

A character can use any high-rating software at a lower rating, to a
minimum of the lowest rating shown.

Programs above Rating/1 cannot be copied easily, as they require a
non-trivial amount of bandwidth to transfer.

#### Table: Computer Software

| Software              | Rating | TL  | Cost             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Drugs

Medications often supplement the direct medical attention of a trained
health professional. The following drugs are commonly encountered in
Cepheus Engine campaigns.

#### Table: Drugs

| Description           | TL  | Cost    |
|-----------------------|-----|---------|
| Medicinal Drugs       | 5   | Cr5+    |
| Anti-Radiation Drugs  | 8   | Cr1,000 |
| Panaceas              | 8   | Cr200   |
| Stim Drugs            | 8   | Cr50    |
| Combat Drug           | 10  | Cr1,000 |
| Fast Drug             | 10  | Cr200   |
| Metabolic Accelerator | 10  | Cr500   |
| Medicinal Slow Drug   | 11  | Cr500   |
| Anagathics            | 15  | Cr2,000 |

**Anagathics**: Slow the user’s aging process. Synthetic anagathics
become possible at TL 15, but there are natural spices and other rare
compounds that have comparable effects at all Technology Levels.
Anagathics are illegal or heavily controlled on many worlds. One dose
must be taken each month to maintain the anti-aging effect – if the
character taking anagathics misses a dose they must make an immediate
roll on the aging table as their body reacts badly to the interrupted
supply.

**Anti-Radiation Drugs**: Must be administered before or immediately
after (within ten minutes) radiation exposure. They absorb up to 100
rads per dose. A character may only use anti-rad drugs once per day –
taking any more causes permanent Endurance damage of 1D6 per dose.

**Combat Drug**: This drug increases reaction time and improves the
body’s ability to cope with trauma, aiding the user in combat. A
character using a combat drug adds +4 to his initiative total at the
start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge
once each round with no effect on his initiative score and reduces all
damage suffered by two points. The drug kicks in twenty seconds (four
rounds) after injection, and lasts around ten minutes. When the drug
wears off, the user is fatigued.

**Fast Drug**: Also known as 'Hibernation', this drug puts the user into
a state akin to suspended animation, slowing his metabolic rate down to
a ratio of 60 to 1 – a subjective day for the user is actually two
months. Fast drug is normally used to prolong life support reserves or
as a cheap substitute for a cryoberth.

**Medicinal Drugs**: These medications include vaccines, antitoxins and
antibiotics. They range in cost from Cr5 to 1D6x1,000 Credits, depending
on the rarity and complexity of the drug. Medicinal drugs require the
Medic skill to use properly – using the wrong drug can be worse than
doing nothing. With a successful Medic check the correct drug can
counteract most poisons or diseases, or at the very least give a
positive DM towards resisting them. If the wrong drug is administered,
treat it as a Difficult (–2 DM) poison with a damage of 1D6.

**Medicinal Slow**: A variant of the slow drug. It can only be applied
safely in a medical facility where life-support and cryo-technology is
available as it increases the metabolism to around thirty times normal,
allowing a patient to undergo a month of healing in a single day.

**Metabolic Accelerator**: Also known as 'Slow Drug', this drug boosts
the user’s reaction time to superhuman levels. A character using slow
drug in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the start of combat
(or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge up to twice each
round with no effect on his initiative score. The drug kicks in 45
seconds (eight rounds) after ingestion or injection and lasts for around
ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user’s system crashes. He
suffers 2D6 points of damage and is exhausted.

**Panaceas**: Wide-spectrum medicinal drugs that are specifically
designed not to interact harmfully. They can therefore be used on any
wound or illness and are guaranteed not to make things worse. A
character using panaceas may make a Medic check as if he had Medic 0
when treating an infection or disease.

**Stim Drugs**: Removes fatigue, at a cost. A character who uses stim
may remove the effects of fatigue but suffers one point of damage. If
stims are used to remove fatigue again without an intervening period of
sleep, the character suffers two points of damage the second time, three
points the third time, and so on.

## Explosives

The Demolitions skill is used with explosives – the Effect of the
Demolitions skill check multiplies the damage, with a minimum of x1
damage for an Effect of 0 or 1. Explosives are not legally available on
any world with a Law Level of 1 or greater.

#### Table: Explosives

| Weapon      | TL  | Damage   | Radius      | Cost (Cr) |
|-------------|-----|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Plastic     | 6   | 3D6      | 2D6 meters  | 200       |
| Pocket Nuke | 12  | 2D6 x 20 | 15D6 meters | 20,000    |
| TDX         | 12  | 4D6      | 4D6 meters  | 1,000     |

**Plastic**: This generic, multi-purpose plastic explosive is a favorite
of military units, terrorists, demolition teams and adventurers across
known space.

**Pocket Nuke**: Hideously illegal on many worlds, the pocket nuke is
actually the size of a briefcase and so is too large to fit into a
grenade launcher.

**TDX**: An advanced gravity-polarized explosive, TDX explodes only
along the horizontal axis.

## Personal Devices

Characters often possess any of a number of personal devices, such as
those described in this section.

#### Table: Personal Devices

| Description            | TL  | Cost      | Wgt |

| Bioscanner             | 15  | Cr350,000 | 3.5 |
| Neural Activity Sensor | 15  | Cr35,000  | 10  |

**Bioscanner**: The bioscanner 'sniffs' for organic molecules and tests
chemical samples, analysing the make-up of whatever it is focussed on.
It can be used to detect poisons or bacteria, analyse organic matter,
search for life signs and classify unfamiliar organisms. The data from a
bioscanner can be interpreted using the Comms or the Life Sciences
skill.

**Densitometer**: The remote densitometer uses an object’s natural
gravity to measure its density, building up a three-dimensional image of
the inside and outside of an object.

**Electromagnetic Probe**: This handy device detects the electromagnetic
emissions of technological devices, and can be used as a diagnostic tool
when examining equipment (+1 DM to work out what’s wrong with it) or
when searching for hidden bugs or devices. The Comms skill can be used
to sweep a room for bugs.

**Hand Calculator**: Allows the user to perform mathematical
calculations quickly.

**Hand Computer**: The ‘handcomp' provides services of a small computer,
plus serves as a computer terminal when linked (by its integral radio,
network interface jack, or by other circuit) to a standard computer.

**Holographic Projector**: A holographic projector is a toaster-sized
box that, when activated, creates a three-dimensional image in the space
around it or nearby – the range is approximately three meters in all
directions. The image can be given pre-programmed animations within a
limited range and the projector includes speakers for making sound. The
projected holograms are obviously not real so this device is mostly used
for communication. The TL 12 version can produce holograms real enough
to fool anyone who fails an Intelligence check (made upon first seeing
the hologram), at double the cost, and the TL 13 version can produce
holograms that are true-to-life images, at ten times the cost.

**Inertial Locator**: Indicates direction and distance traveled from the
starting location.

**Magnetic Compass**: Indicates direction of magnetic north, if any
exists.

**Metal Detector**: Indicates presence of metal within a 3 meter radius
(including underground), with the indicating signal growing stronger as
it gets closer to the source.

**Neural Activity Sensor (NAS)**: This device consists of a backpack and
detachable handheld unit, and can detect neural activity up to 500
meters away. The device can also give a rough estimation of the
intelligence level of organisms based on brainwave patterns. The data
from a neural activity scanner can be interpreted using the Comms, the
Life Sciences or the Social Sciences skills.

**Radiation Counter**: Indicates presence and intensity of radioactivity
within a 30-meter radius. The indicating signal will grow stronger as it
gets closer to the source.

**Wrist Watch**: Allows the user to tell time. At teck level 9, can be
configured to multiple worlds, as well as standard time, and allows the
user to configure alarms based on specific times.

## Robots and Drones

Robots are iconic to science fiction. This section describes the robots
and drones commonly available in a Cepheus Engine campaign. A robot has
an Intellect program running, allowing it to make decisions
independently, while drones are remote-controlled by a character with
the Comms skill.

Robots and drones operate in combat like characters but take damage as
if they were vehicles. They have Hull and Structure characteristics
instead of an Endurance characteristic, and an Endurance DM of 0. Any
robot running an Intellect program has an Intelligence and Education
score. Drones have neither. A robot’s Education characteristic is
representative of the information programmed into it and even low-end
robots can have high Education scores. Most robots have Social Standing
characteristics of 0 as they are not social creations but there are some
exceptions, usually high-end models running advanced Intellect programs.
Drones do not have Social Standing but in cases where they are used to
engage in diplomacy or other social intercourse the operator can use his
own Social Standing score.

**Cargo Robot** (TL 11): These simple, heavy-duty robots are found in
starport docks and on board cargo ships. Cargo drones can be constructed
as low as Technology Level 9 but their utility is extremely limited
until the invention of Intellect programs.

**Combat Drone** (TL 12): Combat drones are little more than flying guns
mated to a grav floater and a computer system. The drones must be
piloted with the Remote Operations skill but attacks are made using the
appropriate weapon skill. Combat drones loaded with Intellect and combat
Expert programs (making them autonomous combat robots) are illegal on
many worlds.

### Robot and Drone Options

**Armor**: Armor can be increased by 5, which increases the drone or
robot’s cost by 25%.

**Integral System**: Certain devices can be built into drones or robots
by increasing the cost of the device by +50%. Popular choices include
toolkits of different kinds, various sensors, or mobility upgrades like
thruster packs or grav floaters.

**Integral Weapon**: Any suitable weapon can be added to a drone or
robot, at the cost of Cr10,000 + the cost of the weapon.

## Sensory Aids

The following aids provide enhance a character’s physical senses.

**Rescue Bubble**: A large (2m diameter) pressurized plastic bubble.
Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user's movements
into electricity to recharge the bubble's batteries and power its
distress beacon, and a small oxygen tank both inflates the bubble and
provides two person/hours of life support. A self-repairing plastic seal
serves as an emergency airlock. Rescue bubbles are found on both space
vessels and water craft as emergency lifeboats.

**Respirator**: A small compressor that allows an individual to breathe
in very thin atmospheres (type 3).

**Swimming Equipment**: Includes swim fins, wet suit, face mask.
Protects against the effects of cold (5º Celsius or below), along with
improving speed and maneuverability underwater; add DM +1 to all
Athletics skill checks in these situations when wearing proper swimming
equipment.

**Thruster Pack**: A simple thruster pack gives the user the ability to
maneuver in zero-gravity. A Zero-G check is required to use a thruster
pack accurately. Thruster packs can only be used in microgravity
environments and are only practical for journeys between spacecraft at
Adjacent range.

**Underwater Air Tanks**: Equivalent to oxygen tanks but designed for
use underwater. Two tanks last 6 hours. Refill of proper atmospheric
mixture for race and expected depth cost Cr20.

**AFV**: A heavily armored ATV, known as an Armored Fighting Vehicle,
equipped with a triple laser turret. The lasers use the Energy Rifle
skill, do 4D6 damage each using the Ranged (rifle) range modifiers, and
one, two or three may be fired at the same target with one attack
action.

**Air/Raft**: An open-topped vehicle supported by anti-gravity
technology. Air/rafts can even reach orbit (taking a number of hours
equal to the world’s Size code) but passengers at that altitude must
wear vacc suits. They are ubiquitous, remarkably reliable and flexible
vehicles.

**ATV**: An enclosed, pressurized all-terrain ground vehicle. The
vehicle is capable of floating on calm water, and has a suite of
built-in sensors and communications equipment (usually a laser
transceiver) making it ideal for exploration. An ATV has a hardpoint for
a turret, but does not come with a weapon normally.

**Biplane Aircraft**: A primitive form of aircraft with two pairs of
wings, one above the other. This vehicle can only transport 100kg of
cargo.

**Destroyer** A fast maneuverable long-endurance watercraft built for
military action, intended to escort larger watercraft in a fleet, convoy
or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range
attackers. Powered by a fusion power plant, the destroyer carries
deck-mounted turrets capable of firing major. Cargo capacity is limited
to 40 tons, mostly used to carry ammunition.

**G/Carrier**: A grav carrier is effectively a flying tank, and is the
standard fighting vehicle of many military forces. The turret-mounted
fusion gun is a vehicle-mounted version of the TL 15 FGMP and uses the
same ‘serious firepower’ rules. Advanced containment systems mean that
it does not leak radiation with each shot in the same way as the
man-portable version. Like the air/raft, the G/Carrier can reach orbit
(taking a number of hours equal to the world’s Size code).

**Grav Belt**: A grav belt resembles a parachute harness, and is fitted
with artificial gravity modules allowing the wearer to fly. The internal
battery can operate for a maximum of four hours before needing to be
recharged. At TL 15, the battery can operate for 12 hours before
charging. Options cannot be added to the grav belt.

**Grav Floater**: A grav floater is a forerunner of the grav belt, a
platform upon which a single person can stand and be carried along. It
cannot achieve any great speed but can, like an air/raft, achieve any
altitude up to orbit (taking a number of hours equal to the world’s Size
code).

**Ground Car**: A ground car is a conventional wheeled automobile.

**Helicopter**: An aircraft that derives both lift and propulsion from
one or more sets of horizontally revolving overhead rotors. It is
capable of moving vertically and horizontally, the direction of motion
being controlled by the pitch of the rotor blades. The helicopter can
carry 500 kg of cargo.

**Hovercraft**: A vehicle that travels over land or water on a cushion
of air provided by a downward blast, the hovercraft is only usable on
words with a Thin atmosphere or thicker. The hovercraft has 3 tons of
cargo space.

**Motor Boat**: Watercraft using hydrofoils to achieve exceptional speed
and performance. The hold of the vehicle can accommodate 10 tons of
cargo.

**Small Steamship**: A watercraft that is propelled by a steam engine.
The steamship has a cargo capacity of 50 tons.

**Speeder**: Capable of high speed transit across a planetary surface,
the speeder is a streamlined grav vehicle with a limited cargo capacity
of 100kg. This vehicle only takes an hour to reach orbit.

**Submersible**: A watercraft designed to operate under an ocean’s
surface. Submersibles are often used as transport between domed cities
on waterworlds and other planets with large fluid oceans. The
submersible can carry 30 tons of cargo.

**Twin Jet Aircraft**: A fixed-wing aircraft propelled by jet engines,
often used to transport cargo. The hold has a cargo capacity of 5 tons.

### Vehicle Options

With the exception of on-board computer, each of these options can only
be taken once on a given vehicle.

**Autopilot** (TL 11): An autopilot has a Model 1 computer specialized
to run Intellect/1 and an Expert/1 in an appropriate skill and
specialty. This will be in addition to any other computers installed. An
autopilot is often mandatory on cheaper commercial models. In many areas
(primarily urban) they are required to be in use. Higher Law Level
polities may require a slave modification to the autopilot for
centralized and/or emergency traffic control. Cr3,000.

**Enclosed**: This modification turns an open vehicle into a closed one.
It costs 10% of the base cost of the vehicle, reduces Agility by 1 and
top speed by 10%.

**Extended Life Support**: A vehicle which is sealed can be equipped for
extended life support, which increases the duration to 18 hours per
person. Costs another 10% of the base cost of the vehicle.

**Heavy Armor**: Increasing the armor of a vehicle by 5 adds 25% to the
cost of the vehicle.

**High Performance**: A vehicle can be made into a high-performance
vehicle, increasing its top speed by 20%. The vehicle costs 50% more.

**On-board Computer**: Adding an on-board computer costs the same as a
hand computer.

**Sealed**: This option can be added to any closed vehicle (it is
included in the ATV, AFV, G/Carrier and Speeder). The vehicle can be
sealed and provides life support for its passengers and crew for two
hours per person. This option adds 20% to the cost of the vehicle.

**Style**: Allows a vehicle to be customized to the buyer’s wishes.
Costs Cr200 to Cr2,000.

**Bayonet**: A small knife-like weapon similar to a dagger, frequently
attached to a rifle. When not attached to a rifle, the bayonet performs
as a dagger.

**Blade**: A hybrid knife weapon with a heavy, flat two-edged blade
nearly 300mm in length, and (often, but not always) a semi-basket
handguard. Because of the bulk of the handguard, it is generally carried
in a belt scabbard. Blades are as much survival tools as weapons, and
are often found in emergency kits, lifeboats etc.

**Broadsword**: The largest of the sword weapons, also called the
two-handed sword because it requires both hands to swing. The blade is
extremely heavy, two-edged, and about 1000 to 1200mm in length. The hilt
is relatively simple, generally a cross-piece only, with little
basketwork or protection. When carried, the broadsword is worn in a
metal scabbard attached to the belt; less frequently, the scabbard is
worn on the back, and the broadsword is drawn over the shoulder.

**Cudgel**: A basic stick used as a weapon. Easily obtained from
standing trees or through the use of an unloaded long gun such as a
rifle or carbine (laser weapons are too delicate to be used as cudgels).
Length: 1000 to 2000mm.

**Cutlass**: A heavy, flat-bladed, single-edged weapon featuring a full
basket hilt to protect the hand. The cutlass is the standard shipboard
blade weapon and sometimes kept in lockers on the bulkhead near
important locations; when worn, a belt scabbard is used. Blade length
varies from 600 to 900mm.

**Dagger**: A small knife weapon with a flat, two-edged blade
approximately 200mm in length. Daggers are usually carried in a belt
sheath, or less frequently concealed in a boot sheath or strapped to the
forearm. Daggers are usually as much a tool as a last-resort weapon of
defense, and worn constantly. Each weighs 250 grams; that weight,
however, does not count against the weight load of the character as the
weapon is worn constantly and comfortably.

**Foil**: Also known as the rapier, this weapon is a light, sword-like
weapon with a pointed, edged blade 800mm in length, and a basket or cup
hilt to protect the hand. Foils are worn in scabbards attached to the
belt.

**Halberd**: A two-handed pole weapon having an axe-like blade and a
steel spike mounted on the end of a long shaft. Length: 2500mm.

**Pike**: A two-handed weapon with a pointed steel or iron head on a
long wooden shaft. Length: 3000 to 4000mm.

**Spear**: A weapon with a long shaft and a pointed tip, typically of
metal, used for thrusting or throwing. Length: 3000mm.

**Sword**: The standard long-edged weapon, featuring a flat, two-edged
blade. It may or may not have a basket hilt or hand protector. A
scabbard to carry the sword may be attached to the belt, or to straps
(or a sash) over the shoulder. Blade length may vary from 700 to 950mm.

### Ranged Weapons

The Common Ranged Weapons table lists the ranged weapons commonly
available in a Cepheus Engine campaign. Each column is described as
follows:

**Cost**: Price in Credits (Cr) or 1000s of Credits (KCr).

**TL**: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item.

**Wgt**: Weight in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).

**RoF**: Rate of Fire. The number of rounds that may be fired during a
significant action in the format: Single Shot / Burst Shot / Automatic
Fire.

**Range**: The range category for this weapon.

**Dmg**: The damage a weapon inflicts.

**Type**: Type of damage inflicted – (B)ludgeoning, (E)nergy, (P)iercing
or (S)lashing.

**Recoil**: Lists if the weapon has recoil when fired.

**LL**: The Law Level where the weapon first becomes illegal.

The Common Ranged Ammunition table describes the cost of ammunitions and
power packs for certain ranged weapons. Each column is described as
follows:

**Cost**: The cost of a full magazine of standard ammunition or power
pack for a weapon.

**TL**: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item.

**Wgt**: The weight of a full magazine or power pack for a weapon.

**Rounds**: The number of rounds the weapon may fire before it must be
reloaded or recharged.

**Accelerator Rifle**: Designed specifically for zero-g combat, the
accelerator rifle fires a specially designed round which upon leaving
the barrel is accelerated by a secondary propelling charge. Normally the
rifle fires bursts of three rounds per pull of the trigger, but may be
adjusted to fire single rounds.

**Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR)**: A progressive development of the
assault rifle.

**Assault Rifle**: A lighter and less expensive version of the automatic
rifle.

**Automatic Rifle**: A highly refined and tuned version of the rifle,
capable of full automatic fire as well as semi-automatic shots.
Normally, the automatic rifle fires bursts of four bullets for each pull
of the trigger. It may be switched to semi-automatic fire at the end of
a combat round, after all firing, in which case it is treated as a rifle
until switched back to burst mode. Ammunition and magazines are
identical to those used for the rifle.

**Auto Pistol**: Also referred to as a Semi-Automatic Pistol, Automatic
Pistol or just a Pistol, the auto pistol is a basic repeating handgun.
One cartridge is fired for each pull of the trigger. Auto pistol
ammunition is interchangeable with submachinegun ammunition (although
magazines are not). Preloaded magazines may be inserted into an empty
pistol, but require a reload action to complete.

**Body Pistol**: A small, non-metallic semiautomatic pistol designed to
evade detection by most weapon detectors. One cartridge is fired for
each pull of the trigger. Pre-loaded magazines may be inserted into the
pistol when it is empty, requiring a reload action to do so. Body pistol
ammunition is not interchangeable with the ammunition for any other
types of guns.

**Bow**: A stout but supple piece of wood carved to a specific shape and
strung with a piece of cord, string or gut to increase tension. The
string is pulled back and released to hurl an arrow long distances with
surprising force. At higher technology levels, bows are modified with
additional strings and pulley systems to add accuracy and power.

**Carbine**: A short type of rifle firing a small caliber round. A
magazine containing ten rounds is inserted into the underside of the
carbine ahead of the trigger guard or behind the handgrip (this
configuration is referred to as “Bullpup”, and in some localities
carbines may be referred to as Bullpups), and one round is fired with
each pull of the trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine takes a
reload action. Carbine ammunition is not interchangeable with any other
type of ammunition. In essence, a carbine is a short rifle, firing a
cartridge of smaller, lighter caliber. A sling usually allows the
carbine to be carried on the shoulder, out of the way.

**Crossbow**: A horizontal bow set into a mechanical firing mechanism
and stronger-than-normal pull, crossbows are very powerful weapons that
are very time consuming to reload. At higher technology levels,
crossbows are built with crank and pulley systems that make the weapons
easier to reload, even self-loading at TL9. Reloading a TL2 crossbow
takes 6 minor actions, at TL4 this is reduced to 3 minor actions.

**Gauss Rifle**: The ultimate development of the slug thrower, the gauss
rifle generates an electromagnetic field along the length of the barrel
which accelerates a bullet to high velocities. The round itself consists
of a dense armor piercing core surrounded by a softer metal covering,
ending in a hollow point, giving the round excellent stopping power and
good armor penetration.

**Laser Carbine**: A lightweight version of the laser rifle, firing high
energy bolts using current from a backpack battery/power pack. The laser
carbine fires a 2mm beam of energy, aimed by integrated optic sights.
The power pack is capable of producing 50 shots before it requires
recharging. Recharging requires at least eight hours connected to a
high-energy source. The laser carbine is connected to the power pack by
a heavy-duty cable.

**Laser Pistol**: A pistol equivalent of the laser carbine, though still
dependent on an external power pack.

**Laser Rifle**: The standard high energy weapon, firing energy bolts in
the same manner as the laser carbine. Heavier, the laser rifle is also
capable of longer sustained action, and is somewhat sturdier. The power
pack can provide 100 shots before recharging. As in the laser carbine,
the laser rifle is connected to the power pack by a heavy-duty cable.
Power packs are not interchangeable between the two weapons, however.

**Revolver**: An early handgun, the revolver fires 9mm bullets with
characteristics similar to those used by the automatic pistol but not
interchangeable with them. No magazine is used: six cartridges are
inserted into the revolver individually. Reloading takes two combat
rounds, or one combat round if the individual foregoes the benefit of
evasion.

**Rifle**: The standard military arm, firing a 7mm, 10 gram bullet at a
velocity of approximately 900 meters per second. Longer and heavier than
a carbine, it is also more effective. Standard equipment includes
provisions for attaching a bayonet and telescopic sights, and a shoulder
sling. A twenty-round magazine is attached to the front of the trigger
guard, and one round is fired with each pull of the trigger. Replacement
of the empty magazine requires a reload action. Rifle ammunition may
also be used in automatic rifles; rifle and auto rifle magazines are
interchangeable, and weigh the same.

**Shotgun**: The basic weapon for maximum shock effect without regard to
accuracy. The shotgun has an 18mm diameter barrel and fires shells
containing either six 7mm bullets, or one hundred and thirty 3mm
pellets. In each case, the projectiles weigh a total of 30 grams.
Velocity for the projectiles is about 350 meters per second. A
cylindrical magazine containing 10 shells is inserted under the barrel
and parallel to it; cartridges are then fed automatically into the
shotgun for firing. Reloading consists of replacing the cylindrical
magazine and takes two combat rounds. One shot is fired for each pull of
the trigger. Magazines measure approximately 350mm long by 20mm in
diameter and are quite clumsy to carry. Shotguns are equipped with a
sling for carrying.

**Snub Pistol**: A low velocity revolver designed for use shipboard and
in zero-g environments.

**Submachinegun (SMG)**: A small automatic weapon designed to fire
pistol ammunition. Magazines holding 30 cartridges are inserted into the
weapon forward of the trigger guard or in the pistol grip, depending on
the design. The gun fires a burst of four rounds per pull of the
trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine requires one combat round.
Submachinegun ammunition (but not magazines) is interchangeable with
autopistol ammunition. Most submachineguns are equipped with slings for
ease of carrying. Some are small enough to be carried in a shoulder or
hip holster.

#### Ranged Weapon Options

The following options are generally available for certain ranged
weapons.

**Folding Stocks**: Carbines, rifles, and shotguns can be equipped with
folding stocks which make it possible to reduce the overall length of
the weapon by 300mm.

**Grenade Launcher**: An underslung RAM grenade launcher can be added to
any rifle. This grenade launcher has a magazine of one grenade, cannot
fire on automatic and takes four minor actions to reload.

**Gyrostabilizer**: Stabilizers can be added to any weapon with recoil,
reducing the recoil penalty by one point (to DM-1).

**Intelligent Weapon**: This adds a Model/ 0 computer to any weapon. The
TL 13 upgrade adds Model /1 to any weapon, for Cr5,000.

**Laser Sight**: Integrated optics and laser sights give an extra +1 DM
bonus to any attack that has been aimed. At TL 10, x-ray lasers and
improved display technology removes the tell-tale ‘red dot’ of a
vislight laser. Cr200.

**Laser Telescopic Sights**: Electronic sights combining the
capabilities of both electronic and telescopic sights. They are still
rather fragile.

**Secure Weapon**: A secure weapon requires authentication in some
fashion (scanning the user’s DNA or iris patterns, entering a password,
transmission of an unlocking code from a comm) before it can be fired.

**Shoulder Stocks**: It is possible to produce a shoulder stock which
may be attached temporarily to a pistol or revolver, resulting in a
crude carbine arrangement and some greater accuracy at longer ranges.
When firing a pistol or revolver equipped with such a stock, treat the
weapon as ranged (shotgun). The overall length of the pistol is
increased by the length of the stock, and the pistol cannot be
holstered. Attaching the stock (or detaching it) requires five combat
rounds.

**Silencer**: A silencer can be added to any slug thrower with ROF 4 or
less, masking the sound produced by firing. (–4 DM to detect.)

**Telescopic Sights**: High-quality telescopic sights for attachment to
weapons, for increasing their accuracy, especially at longer ranges. A
weapon equipped with such sights gains an extra +1 DM bonus to any
attack that has been aimed. Telescopic sights are delicate, however, and
may be jarred out of alignment by any violent action (such as being left
untended in a moving truck, a close explosion, or being dropped) on an
8+ on 2D6. When the sights go out of adjustment, the firer will always
miss.

### Grenades

A grenade is a small explosive device designed to be thrown by hand
(treat as Ranged (thrown) for Difficulty by range) or launched from a
grenade launcher (treat as Ranged (shotgun) for Difficulty by range). A
number of grenades are described in the Common Grenades table. Each
column is described as follows:

**Cost**: Price in Credits (Cr) for a case of six grenades.

**TL**: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item.

**Wgt**: Weight per grenade in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).

**Damage**: The damage a weapon inflicts.

**LL**: The Law Level where the weapon first becomes illegal.

#### Table: Common Grenades

| Weapon  | TL  | Cost per Case | Wgt | Damage                       | LL  |
|---------|-----|---------------|-----|------------------------------|-----|
| Frag    | 6   | 180           | 0.5 | 5D6/3D6/1D6; see description | 1   |
| Smoke   | 6   | 90            | 0.5 | Special; see description     | 1   |
| Aerosol | 9   | 90            | 0.5 | Special; see description     | 1   |
| Stun    | 9   | 180           | 0.5 | 3D6 stun; see description    | 1   |

**Aerosol**: Aerosol grenades create a fine mist six meters in radius
that diffuses lasers but does not block normal vision. Any laser attack
made through the mist has its damage reduced by 10. Laser communications
through the mist are completely blocked. The mist dissipates in 1D6x3
rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce
this time.

**Frag**: The damage from fragmentation grenades decreases with distance
from the blast:

#### Table: Frag Grenade Damage by Distance

| Distance | Damage |
|----------|--------|
| 3 meters | 5D6    |
| 6 meters | 3D6    |
| 9 meters | 1D6    |

**Smoke**: Smoke grenades create a thick cloud of smoke six meters in
radius, centered on the location of the grenade. This smoke imposes a –2
DM on all attacks within or through the cloud (doubled for laser
weapons). Smoke dissipates in 1D6x3 rounds, although high winds and
other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.

**Stun**: Stun weapons, such as stun grenades, are non-lethal and do not
inflict normal damage. A character within six meters of a stun grenade
detonation must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the
damage (after armor is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed
the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is
successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun
damage is ignored.

### Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons are man-portable and larger weapons that cause extreme
property damage. Common Heavy Weapons table lists the heavy weapons
commonly available in a Cepheus Engine campaign. Each column is
described as follows:

**Cost**: Price in Credits (Cr) or 1000s of Credits (KCr).

**TL**: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item.

**Wgt**: Weight in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).

**RoF**: Rate of Fire. The number of rounds that may be fired during a
significant action in the format: Single Shot / Auto

**Range**: The range category for this weapon.

**Damage**: The damage a weapon inflicts.

**Recoil**: Lists if the weapon has recoil when fired.

**LL**: The Law Level where the weapon first becomes illegal.

The Common Heavy Weapons Ammunition table describes the cost of
ammunitions and power packs for certain heavy weapons. Each column is
described as follows:

**Cost**: The cost of a full magazine of standard ammunition or power
pack for a weapon

**TL**: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item.

**Wgt**: The weight of a full magazine or power pack for a weapon.

**Rounds**: The number of rounds the weapon may fire before it must be
reloaded or recharged.

#### Table: Common Heavy Weapons

| Weapon               | TL  | Cost    | Wgt | RoF | Range                   | Damage     | Recoil | LL  |
|----------------------|-----|---------|-----|-----|-------------------------|------------|--------|-----|
| Grenade Launcher     | 7   | 400     | 6   | 1   | ranged (shotgun)        | By grenade | Yes    | 3   |
| Rocket Launcher      | 7   | 2,000   | 6   | 1   | ranged (rocket)         | 4D6        | No     | 3   |
| RAM Grenade Launcher | 8   | 800     | 6   | 1/3 | ranged (assault weapon) | By grenade | Yes    | 3   |
| PGMP                 | 12  | 20,000  | 10  | 1/4 | ranged (rifle)          | 10D6       | Yes    | 2   |
| FGMP                 | 14  | 100,000 | 12  | 1/4 | ranged (rifle)          | 16D6       | Yes    | 2   |

#### Table: Common Heavy Weapon Ammunition

| Weapon               | TL  | Cost   | Wgt | Rounds |
|----------------------|-----|--------|-----|--------|
| Grenade Launcher     | 7   | 180    | 0.5 | 6      |
| Rocket Launcher      | 7   | 300    | 1   | 1      |
| RAM Grenade Launcher | 8   | 180    | 0.5 | 6      |
| PGMP                 | 12  | 2,500  | 6   | 40     |
| FGMP                 | 14  | 65,000 | 9   | 40     |

**FGMP (Fusion Gun, Man-Portable)**: It includes a gravity suspension
system to reduce its inertia, making it easier to use than the PGMP
(minimum Strength 9) and fires what amounts to a directed nuclear
explosion. Those without radiation protection who are nearby when a FGMP
is fired will suffer a lethal dose of radiation – each firing of an FGMP
emits 2D6 x 20 rads, which will affect everyone within the immediate
vicinity.

**Grenade Launcher**: Grenade launchers are used to fire grenades over
long distances. Grenades for a grenade launcher are not interchangeable
with handheld grenades.

**PGMP (Plasma Gun, Man-Portable)**: It is so heavy and bulky that it
can only be used easily by a trooper with a Strength of 12 or more –
usually attained by wearing battle dress. Every point by which a user’s
Strength falls short is a –1 DM on any attack rolls made with it.

**RAM Grenade Launcher**: Rocket Assisted Multi-purpose grenade
launchers have a longer range and are capable of firing up to three
grenades with a single attack. This uses the rules for firing on full
auto; unlike other automatic weapons, a RAM grenade launcher cannot fire
in burst mode. It takes two minor actions to reload a RAM grenade
launcher. Grenades for a RAM grenade launcher are not interchangeable
with handheld grenades.

**Rocket Launcher**: To counteract the recoil of the weapon, a rocket
launcher channels exhaust backwards in an explosive back blast. Anyone
up to 1.5 meters behind a rocket launcher when it fires takes 3D6 damage
from the burning gasses. Vehicle-mounted rocket launchers lose this
side-effect as a vehicle is a more stable firing platform than a person.
It takes three minor actions to reload a rocket launcher.

The rockets presented are high-explosive models. Do not add the Effect
of the attack roll to their damage but apply that damage to everything
within six meters of the impact point. A rocket that misses has a 50%
chance (4+ on 1D6) of detonating upon impact with the ground (6 – Effect
meters away in a random direction). Otherwise it will miss completely
and leave the battlefield without striking anything or detonating.
