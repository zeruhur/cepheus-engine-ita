# CHAPTER 14: SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS

In the Cepheus Engine, an encounter is defined as an unexpected or
casual meeting with someone or something. A large part of the Referee’s
job is the administration of encounters. Through encounters, the Referee
presents information, opportunities and conflicts for the players to
interact with, which is the core of any gaming session.

There are a number of different types of social encounters: routine,
legal, patron, random, rumor and scenario. The Encounter Types Overview
table offers suggestions on the frequency of various encounters, and the
chance associated with the occurrence of such an encounter.

**Encounter Tables**: This chapter provides a number of encounter tables
to serve as inspiration for the Referee. The Referee is encouraged to
create tables more in line with their Cepheus Engine universe or with
the specific adventure they are running.

#### Table: Encounter Types Overview

| Encounter Type | Frequency | Chance                   |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Routine        | As needed | As needed                |
| Scenario       | As needed | As needed                |
| Legal          | Daily     | Law Level or less on 2D6 |
| Random         | Daily     | 8+ on 2D6                |
| Patron         | Weekly    | 9+ on 2D6                |
| Rumor          | Weekly    | 7+ on 2D6                |

## Routine Encounters

Routine encounters involve meeting normal people while doing normal
activities, such as interviewing potential crew members in a starport
diner or buying new ammunition from the clerk in a gun shop. Such scenes
are rarely important in and of themselves. From a roleplaying
perspective, routine encounters create a background of expected behavior
that makes scenario encounters and random encounters stand out in
comparison because of their unexpected content. Routine encounters help
move characters logically from the time and place of one important scene
to the next.

## Scenario Encounters

Within the Cepheus Engine rules, an adventure is defined as a story for
players to experience, comprised of a series of related scenes or
encounters. These related encounters are called scenario encounters,
because they serve to further the plot of the adventure toward its
climax. The Referee creates scenario encounters as dictated by the story
they will tell.

## Random Encounters

Random encounters offer players a sense of variety in their gaming
experience. These colorful encounters often include individuals pursuing
goals that are unrelated to those of the adventurers themselves. From a
roleplaying perspective, random encounters help create the illusion of a
universe that exists outside of the adventurers' experiences, thus
creating a sense of verisimilitude.

Random encounters can be determined by rolling a D66 on a table such as
the Random Encounters table presented in these rules. Unique tables
might be created for specific worlds or adventures. As with other social
encounters, non-player character reactions may be determined randomly by
the Referee or selected according to the nature of the situation.

| 65  | Workers                     |
| 66  | Referee’s Choice            |

## Legal Encounters

Legal encounters involve interactions with local planetary law
enforcement. Some worlds have stricter laws than others. This is
represented by the world's Law Level value. The higher the Law Level,
the more likely that offworld visitors will be harassed by local law
enforcement. When the Referee determines that a legal encounter happens,
a local police officer will stop the adventurers and require
identification. Further complications are at the Referee's discretion.

## Patron Encounters

A patron is a non-player character that gives financial or other support
to a person, organization, cause, or activity. Referees often use
patrons as a tool to attempt to engage player characters in adventures.
Patron encounters represent the beginning of an open-ended adventure
idea, aka the hook. The patron provides the mission that serves as the
basis for an adventure, as well as the reward for successfully
completing it.

Adventurers frequently seek out patrons as a source of employment. Less
frequently, a patron may seek out the adventurers, based on their
reputation. The Referee may roll a D66 on the Patron Encounters table or
create one independently. Unique Patron Encounter tables might be
created for specific worlds or adventures.

### Format for Patron Encounters

Some Referees prefer to “wing it,” and consider little more than a
patron’s name and the mission at hand. However, for those seeking a more
detailed way of creating reusable patron encounters, the Cepheus Engine
rules offers a fairly comprehensive format for recording patron
encounters. This format identifies five specific elements for a given
patron. These are:

-   The patron’s name and role. Names can be changed if the patron
    encounter is reused.

-   The skills and resources required to complete the mission

-   The suggested reward for the mission

-   The mission as described to the characters

-   What’s really going on. Several possible variants are presented –
    either pick or roll for which is the real situation. This is the key
    element that allows reusability.

Here is an example of a patron encounter captured in this format:

### Bruce Ayala, Interplanetary Playboy

**Required**: Investigate, Streetwise; No special equipment required.

**Reward**: Cr500 a day, plus expenses; minimum of two weeks.

#### Players’ Information

Word on the street is that the famous holovid star and interplanetary
playboy Bruce Ayala is cruising the local bar scene. That night, Bruce
Ayala, along with his entourage of publicists and models, staggers into
the same locale as the party and buys a round for every offworlder. Over
the course of the evening, he continually hounds the party for details
of their exploits, always comparing their adventures to roles he's
portrayed. Late into the evening, Ayala corners one of the party members
and offers the crew a job, if it can be handled with discretion. He
provides contact information, and arranges a meeting to discuss terms,
if they are interested.

#### Referee’s Information

When Bruce Ayala achieved system-wide fame as a holovid star, he admits
that it went right to his head, and it cost him the love of a wonderful
young woman by the name of Martha McKernan. He's kept tabs on Martha
over the years through private investigators and the like, one of whom
has reported that she's gone missing a few days ago. Ayala wants to hire
the party to discretely investigate Martha's disappearance, locate the
young woman and rescue her from whatever situation she might be in. He's
concerned that his current media distributor, Penultimate Productions,
have pulled something, as he has been secretly planning to sign a new
contract with a competitor, System Media Studios. That represents a
great loss for Penultimate Productions, and Ayala feels that they are
not above coercion to insure the holovid star continues to bring them
money. In all of the options presented below, further development is
left to the discretion of the Referee.

1.  All is as it appears. Bruce Ayala is correct; Penultimate
    Productions has discovered their star's clandestine plans. Slowly
    moving away from the verge of bankruptcy, the media distributor owes
    their recovery to Bruce Ayala's success in the box office. Worried
    that the star's departure could cost them everything, the executive
    producers have hired thugs to kidnap Martha McKernan and use her to
    force him to extend his current contract.

2.  Sadly, Bruce Ayala is incorrect. His own agent, Cornelius Brass, has
    a gambling problem, a huge gambling problem. He's fallen in so much
    debt to the local crime syndicate that they've started threatening
    his life and the lives of his family, and the man has become
    desperate. Brass has arranged for the kidnapping of Martha McKernan,
    hoping to ransom her to enough Credits to pay off his debt and tuck
    away a tidy bankroll so he can continue his gambling habit.

3.  Bruce Ayala has been less than truthful. He's been stalking the
    innocent Martha McKernan for years, using his fame and fortune to
    attempt to force her into marrying him. In an act of desperation,
    Martha has gone on the run, trying to make her way out of the star
    system undetected in an effort to find safety from Ayala's
    overwhelming attentions.

4.  System Media Studios has kidnapped Martha McKernan as a form of
    leverage to use on Bruce Ayala in the event he changes his mind and
    backs out of the secret negotiations. They believe he is unaware of
    her disappearance, and only intend to reveal her status as a
    prisoner should he start entertaining the thought of extending his
    current contract with Penultimate Productions.

5.  Martha McKernan has watched Bruce Ayala's meteoric rise to success
    with envy and jealousy. She feels scorned by the holovid star, and
    every image of Bruce Ayala with some starlet has pushed her further
    into the depths of hatred and loathing. Martha has arranged her own
    "kidnapping", so that she can demand a costly ransom from Bruce. Any
    extended contact with Martha will reveal that she is not completely
    sane, and will likely go to extreme lengths to harm and humiliate
    Bruce Ayala.

6.  Martha McKernan is actually on vacation, hiking deep in a wilderness
    preserve to get away from civilization for a few weeks. Edmund Sang,
    a private investigator employed by Bruce Ayala, has reported her
    missing simply to get more money from Mr. Ayala to "locate" her.
    When the party shows up and begins investigating, he realizes that
    he might get caught and so desperately attempts to redirect them, to
    avoid having his deception discovered. Sang's efforts to create a
    false trail points to the local crime syndicate, who do not take
    kindly to the party investigating their illicit activities looking
    for a girl they've never heard of.

## Rumors

Rumors are best thought of as encounters with information rather than
with people or events. Rumors often fill one of two different roles:
they plant the seed for a potential new adventure, or they provide
background information that makes the universe seem larger than just the
character's experiences. Rumors can take many forms, including, but not
limited to, graffiti on the walls, newspaper or online articles,
overheard conversations, secret notes, and televised broadcasts.

Because rumors are encounters with information, the player character has
no patron should they decide to pursue the rumor itself. If the matter
doesn't pan out, the player character has no one to blame but himself.
However, given the promise of potential reward, enterprising characters
are likely to attempt to exploit the information they've uncovered.

Random encounters are often determined by rolling a D66 on a table such
as the Random Rumor Content table presented in these rules. As with
other encounter types, unique tables might be created for specific
worlds or adventures.

#### Table: Random Rumor Content

| D66 | Encounter                                    |

## Influencing Attitudes

The Referee determines the starting attitude of any character the
characters encounter during the game. The characters can then try to
influence the character's attitude using Social Standing and various
interaction skills, such as Liaison and Carousing. The Attitude
Descriptions table describes the effects of character attitudes.

#### Table: Attitude Descriptions

| Attitude    | Means                         | Possible Actions                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Hostile     | Will take risks to oppose you | Attack, interfere, berate, flee                    |
| Unfriendly  | Wishes you ill                | Mislead, gossip, avoid, watch suspiciously, insult |
| Indifferent | Doesn't care either way       | Socially acceptable interaction                    |
| Friendly    | Wishes you well               | Chat, advise, offer limited help, advocate         |
| Helpful     | Will take risks to aid you    | Protect, back up, heal, aid, support               |

Characters can attempt to improve another's attitude, using a Difficult
(-2) Social Standing-based check using the appropriate skill, usually
Liaison. With a success, the character's attitude is improved by one
step; with an exceptional success, the attitude improves by two steps.
Note that a particularly bad influence check can actually make a
character's attitude worse. On an exceptional failure, the character's
attitude shifts one step more Hostile. In general, a character can
attempt to influence another character only once in any given scene.

Players get to choose their characters’ attitudes, and so interaction
skills cannot force a player-character to behave in a specific way.
Typically, the only way a player character can be forced into a
particular behavior is through the use of psionics or some other
external force.
