# CHAPTER 2: SKILLS

Characters in Cepheus Engine games engage in a variety of activities,
using their various skills to accomplish the challenges that confront
them. Skills and their usage are described in this chapter.

## Skill Checks

Skill checks use the core task resolution system for the Cepheus Engine
to resolve actions. Whenever your character attempts any action with a
chance of failure, roll 2D6, add any skill levels, the appropriate
characteristic score modifier, and your difficulty DM. If the result
equals or exceeds 8, the action succeeds. If the result is lower than 8,
the action fails. The basics of the task resolution system can be found
in the **Introduction** chapter, under **Die Rolls**.

### Task Description Format

Task descriptions can be formally written in a specific format, as
follows.

*Task Description*: Required Skill, Characteristic, Time Increment,
Difficulty.

**Task Description**: Describes the action of the task itself. In print,
this is often italicized to help it stand out.

**Required Skill**: The skill required for the task. Skill levels are
added as a positive DM to the check. Unskilled characters suffer a -3 DM
if they do not have this skill.

**Characteristic**: The characteristic modifier that is added to the
check.

**Time Increment**: The time range required to perform the task.

#### Informal Skill Check Descriptions

Skill checks are also informally written by Difficulty followed by
Required Skill throughout this System Reference Document. For example,
repairing damage on a starship in mid-combat might be a Very Difficult
(–4) Engineering task. When listed in this manner, the Referee gets to
choose an appropriate Characteristic to modify the skill check, as well
as the time increment involved, if it is not already obvious from
context.

### Untrained and Zero-Level Skills

Characters can perform some tasks without any training in a skill, using
only raw talent (defined by their characteristic scores), but skilled
characters tend to be better at such things. Unless the Referee says you
cannot, you can always attempt tasks involving that skill even if you
have no training in it.

If a character has no level in a skill, then he is untrained and will
suffer a –3 Dice Modifier when trying to use that skill.

If a character has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then he is competent
in using that skill, but has little experience. He does not get any
bonus from his skill ranks when using that skill but at least he avoids
the penalty for being untrained.

### Going Faster or Slower

You can choose, before you roll, to move up or down one or two rows on
the Time Frames table. Moving up (reducing the time increment) gives you
a –1 DM for every row you move; moving down and increasing the time
taken gives you a +1 DM for every row you move. Your Referee will help
adjudicate any issues that might arise from a change in the time frame.

#### Table: Time Frames

| Time Frame      | Base Increment                                             |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1D6 seconds     | One second                                                 |
| 1D6 rounds      | One personal combat round (6 seconds)                      |
| 1D6 minutes     | One minute (60 seconds, or 10 personal combat rounds)      |
| 1D6 kiloseconds | One kilosecond (\~16.67 minutes, or one space combat turn) |
| 1D6 hours       | One hour (60 minutes)                                      |
| 1D6 days        | One day (24 hours)                                         |
| 1D6 weeks       | One week (7 days)                                          |
| 1D6 months      | One common month (30-31 days)                              |
| 1D6 quarter     | One quarter (3 common months)                              |

### Multiple Actions

A character can try to do two or more things at once, like firing a
spacecraft’s weapons while also flying, or disarming a bomb while hiding
from guards. For every extra thing that the character is doing, he
suffers a –2 DM to all skill checks.

### Local Law Level

Some tasks are impacted by a world’s local Law Level, as presented in
the Universal World Profile. For tasks that are impacted by the local
laws, rules and regulations, the usual difficulty for tasks can be found
in the Base Difficulty by Law Level table.

#### Table: Base Difficulty by Law Level

| Law Level | Difficulty            |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| 0         | Routine (DM+2)        |
| 1-3       | Average (DM+0)        |
| 4-6       | Difficult (DM-2)      |
| 7-9       | Very Difficult (DM-4) |
| 10+       | Formidable (DM-6)     |

## Available Skills List

The following is a list of the available skills used in the core Cepheus
Engine rules. Referees may add other skills as needed to better fit the
universe they have created.

## Skill Descriptions

This section describes each skill found in the Cepheus Engine, including
its common uses. You may be able to use skills for tasks other than
those given here. The Referee sets the Difficulty and decides the
results in all cases.

### Admin

The character has experience with bureaucratic agencies, and understands
the requirements of dealing with and managing them. When attempting
tasks like avoiding police harassment, ensuring the prompt issuance of
licenses, approval of applications, avoidance of close inspection of
papers, etc., a successful Admin skill check (with a Difficulty based on
Base Difficulty by Law Level table), will provide a positive outcome to
the situation.

**Bureaucrats and Administrators**: Dealing with administrators and
bureaucrats is always a time consuming and tedious chore, which somehow
seems to play a common part in Cepheus Engine adventures. No special
skills are needed to deal with bureaucrats, but characters with the
Admin (or Advocate) skill will be familiar with their ways and find the
task much smoother and easier.

The offer of a bribe and a Bribery skill check may also be attempted in
place of an ability or Admin or Advocate skill check. See the
**Bribery** skill description for more information.

### Advocate

The character is familiar with the general laws and regulations that
govern interstellar travel, commerce and relations. This skill does not
impart knowledge of the myriad of laws on each individual world, nor
does it allow the person to act as an attorney.

**Ship Inspections**: Typically, when a ship arrives at a new world, it
will be inspected by the port authorities to check for compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations. It is also not uncommon for patrol
ships to stop and board merchant and other ships while in deep space.
When such an inspection does occur, the character may make an Advocate
check (with a Difficulty based on Base Difficulty by Law Level table) to
be found in compliance and pass inspection. If there is anything illegal
on board, the character suffers a -2 DM to the check.

### Aircraft (Cascade Skill)

The various specialties of this skill cover different types of flying
vehicles. When this skill is received, the character must immediately
select one of the following: Grav Vehicle, Rotor Aircraft or Winged
Aircraft.

### Animals (Cascade Skill)

The various specialties of this skill cover different aspects of animal
handling. When this skill is received, the character must immediately
select one of the following: Farming, Riding, Survival, or Veterinary
Medicine.

### Archery

The character is skilled at using bows and crossbows for hunting or in
combat.

### Athletics

This skill covers physical fitness and training, similar to that of a
trained athlete. This includes acts requiring physical coordination,
such as climbing, juggling or throwing; acts of endurance, such as
long-distance running or hiking; and acts of strength, such as
weight-lifting or bodybuilding.

**Aliens with Wings**: For alien species with wings, this skill is also
used to reflect their ability to fly.

### Battle Dress

This skill permits the character to operate advanced battle armor, a
powered form of combat armor that enhances the wearer's capabilities in
various ways. Ground-based military forces, and numerous mercenaries,
are often trained in the basics of battle dress operation. This skill
also covers the ability to operate vehicles designed as mechanical
exoskeletons.

### Bay Weapons

The character is skilled at operating bay weapons on board a ship.

### Bludgeoning Weapons

The character is skilled at using bludgeoning weapons, such as clubs,
staffs and really big wrenches, in personal combat.

### Bribery

The character has experience in bribing petty and not-so petty officials
in order to circumvent regulations or ignore cumbersome laws. The amount
of a bribe is often based on the level of offense, as outlined in the
Bribery Checks By Offense table.

#### Table: Bribery Checks By Offense

| Offense                       | DM  | Minimum Bribe |
|-------------------------------|-----|---------------|
| Petty Crime or Infraction     | +2  | 1D6xCr10      |
| Misdemeanor, Minor Infraction | +0  | 1D6xCr50      |
| Serious Crime or Infraction   | -2  | 1D6xCr100     |
| Capital Crime or Infraction   | -4  | 1D6xCr500     |

If the bribe is less than the minimum bribe required, the attempt will
automatically fail. Characters may offer more than the minimum bribe
required and receive a +1 DM for each multiple of the bribe offered. If
the first offer is refused, a character may make a second attempt at
twice the previous value of the bribe. If both attempts are refused
(failed), the Referee should have the character make a Social Standing
check, with a Difficulty based on Base Difficulty by Law Level table. If
this also fails, the character will be brought up on charges of
attempted bribery.

For example, a character trying to bribe an official to ignore a minor
smuggling infraction would have to offer a minimum bribe of Cr200. If
the character offered Cr400 instead the character could gain a +1 DM on
the check. If Cr600 were offered, the character could gain a +2 DM, etc.

### Broker

A broker is skilled in locating suppliers and buyers, and facilitating
the purchase and resale of commercial goods, as per the **Trade and
Commerce** rules.

### Carousing

This skill reflects the interpersonal art of interacting and socializing
with others. The character is skilled in the art of small talk and
making others feel at ease in their presence in almost any social
situation, such as a party, ball, inauguration, bar hopping, etc.

### Comms

The character is trained in the use, repair, and maintenance of
communications and sensor devices. While anyone can press the button and
make a communicator function, this skill is necessary to understand why
the device does not work, or how to use the device for purposes other
than open transmission. When using sensors, this skill allows the
character to interpret the long-range data of a ship's sensors and
scanners. Skilled characters can boost an incoming or outgoing signal,
create or break a secure channel, detect signals and anomalies, hide or
piggyback on another signal, jam local communications, locate and assess
potential threats, and analyze complex sensor data.

### Computer

The character is skilled in the programming and operation of electronic
and fiber optic computers, both ground and shipboard models. Computers
can be found on any world with a TL of 8 or higher, becoming
exponentially more common at higher technology levels.

A character without at least some computer training might find himself
at disadvantage in the highly technical universe of science fiction.
Anyone with Computer-0 or better can perform the following without a
skill check: Log on to a Datanet, send and receive messages, search for
non-classified information, and retrieve data and files. More skilled
users can create or break data encryption; mine data effectively; create
or break data and network security protocols; and perform other general
programming tasks.

### Demolitions

This skill covers the use of demolition charges and other explosive
devices, including assembling or disarming bombs.

### Electronics

The character is practiced in installing, using, maintaining, repairing
and/or creating electronic devices and equipment. The character can
practice a trade and make a decent living, earning a paycheck for every
week of dedicated work. The character knows how to use the tools of the
trade, how to perform routine tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers,
and how to handle common problems.

**Disabling Devices**: The character is skilled at disarming alarm
systems, picking electronic locks, disabling a malfunctioning robot, or
similar tasks involving electronic devices.

### Energy Pistol

The character is skilled at using advanced pistol-style energy weapons
like laser pistols and stunners.

### Energy Rifle

The character is skilled at using advanced energy weapons like laser
rifles or plasma rifles.

### Engineering

The character is skilled in the operation and maintenance of starship
maneuver drives, Jump drives, and power plants. The character can
practice a trade and make a decent living, earning a paycheck for every
week of dedicated work. The character knows how to use the tools of the
trade, how to perform routine tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers,
and how to handle common problems. Engineering is particularly important
in diverting power to the Jump Drives for a successful transition into
Jump space.

### Farming

The character can grow and harvest crops and raise animals. This also
covers hydroponic farming and clone harvesting for food production, at
sufficiently high tech levels.

### Gambling

The individual is well informed on games of chance, and wise in their
play. He or she has an advantage over non-experts, and is generally
capable of winning when engaged in such games. Gambling, however, should
not be confused with general risk-taking.

**Non-Competitive Games**: These are games such as Slots, Roulette,
Blackjack, Keno, etc. These games are played strictly against the house
and the odds are pretty much constant, as are the payoff values. The
character chooses a game by its odds of winning (high, average, low,
small or remote) and places a bet. The Referee determines if the game is
rigged. The character then rolls their Gambling score. On a success, the
character receives the payoff amount based on the amount of their
initial bet. House always wins on a natural 2.

#### Table: Gambling by Odds of Winning

| Odds of Winning | DM  | Payoff | Maximum Bet |
|-----------------|-----|--------|-------------|
| Rigged          | -8  | Varies | Varies      |
| Remote          | -6  | 1:10   | Cr5,000     |
| Small           | -4  | 1:8    | Cr1,000     |
| Low             | -2  | 1:4    | Cr500       |
| Average         | +0  | 1:2    | Cr100       |
| High            | +2  | 2:3    | Cr50        |

**Competitive Games**: If playing against a group of other players, each
member of the game will make their Gambling skill check with the highest
roll taking the pot. A character may attempt to cheat during a game at
any time by stating his or her intent to cheat and making an extra
Gambling check. If any other player in the game makes a successful
opposing Gambling check against the character's attempt at cheating they
are caught red-handed. Otherwise the player has successfully cheated and
takes the pot. If more than one person attempts to cheat during the same
round of play, the person with the highest roll wins the pot.

### Grav Vehicle

This skill grants the ability to properly maneuver and perform basic,
routine maintenance on air/rafts and other vehicles that use gravitic
technology. Grav vehicles have theoretically perfect maneuverability and
can hover, but skill checks may be necessary when performing high-speed
aerobatics.

### Gravitics

The character is practiced in installing, maintaining, repairing and/or
creating gravitic devices and equipment. Such items include air/raft
lift modules, grav belts, grav sleds, grav tanks, etc. Gravitics skill
deals with the technical details of such vehicles; Grav Vehicle skill is
required to actually pilot or drive them. The character can practice a
trade and make a decent living, earning a paycheck for every week of
dedicated work. The character knows how to use the tools of the trade,
how to perform routine tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and
how to handle common problems.

### Gun Combat (Cascade Skill)

The various specialties of this skill cover different types of ranged
personal weapons. When this skill is received, the character must
immediately select one of the following: Archery, Energy Pistol, Energy
Rifle, Shotgun, Slug Pistol, or Slug Rifle.

### Gunnery (Cascade Skill)

The various specialties of this skill cover different types of
devastating weapons commonly used against vehicles, spaceships and
ground installations. When this skill is received, the character must
immediately select one of the following: Bay Weapons, Heavy Weapons,
Screens, Spinal Mounts, or Turret Weapons.

### Heavy Weapons

The Heavy Weapons skill covers man-portable and larger weapons that
cause extreme property damage, such as rocket launchers, artillery and
plasma weapons.

### Jack-of-All-Trades (Jack o' Trades or JoT)

The Jack of All Trades skill works differently to other skills. It
reduces the unskilled penalty a character receives for not having the
appropriate skill by one for every level of Jack of All Trades. Jack of
All Trades cannot grant a skill bonus at higher levels.

### Leadership

The character possesses the ability to rally, inspire, organize and
direct team efforts to ensure the best cooperation and productivity
possible.

**Coordinating Effort**: Whenever a task requires one or more characters
to combine their efforts (i.e. Teamwork; each makes a skill or ability
check towards a common goal), the character gains a pool of points equal
to the Effect of the skill check (minimum of 1), which can be
distributed by the leader to individual team members as DMs (grant a +1
DM per point) on skill or ability checks made toward the common goal.

**Improving Initiative**: The Leadership skill can be used to increase
another character's Initiative. The character with Leadership makes a
Leadership check, and the target character's Initiative is increased by
the Effect of the check. Making a Leadership skill check is a
significant action.

### Linguistics

The character can read and write a different language for every level of
Linguistics they possess. All characters can speak and read their native
language without needing the Linguistics skill, and automated computer
translator programs mean that the Linguistics skill are not always
needed on other worlds. Having Linguistics-0 implies that the character
has a smattering of simple phrases in many languages. In addition,
Linguistics can be used to attempt to decipher the general meaning of a
preserved specimen of language, such as an inscription or a recorded
message.

### Liaison

The character is trained in the art of dealing with others, including
knowledge of proper protocols, manners of address, codes of conduct and
other information needed when dealing with a wide range of societal
types. Such a character is quite useful when attempting to negotiate a
particularly edgy deal, to convince the Duke's secretary to admit the
party into the Duke's presence, help settle a dispute between two
opposing groups, or other acts of negotiation and diplomacy.

**Influencing Others**: The character can change others' attitudes with
a successful check. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Liaison
checks to see who gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve cases
when two diplomats are engaged in negotiations.

### Life Sciences

This skill represents theoretical and practical knowledge derived from
the scientific study of living organisms. This covers a wide range of

## Gaining New Skill Levels during Game Play

A character’s Skill Total is calculated by summing the levels of each
skill (level zero skills count as zero). A character with Mechanics 1
and Slug Pistol 2 would have a Skill Total of 3.

To increase a skill, a character must train for a number of weeks equal
to his current Skill Total plus the desired level of the skill. So, to
advance from Piloting 2 to Piloting 3 with a current Skill Total of 3
would take (three, plus three) six weeks. A character may only train one
skill in a given week.

The Jack of all Trades skill cannot be learned.
