# CHAPTER 11: ENVIRONMENTS AND HAZARDS

The following are common environmental hazards that are can be
encountered in a Cepheus Engine game.

## Acid

Corrosive acids deal 1D6 damage per round of exposure, except in the
case of total immersion (such as into a vat of acid), which deals 10D6
damage per round. An attack with acid, such as from a hurled vial or an
animal's acidic spittle, counts as a round of exposure.

The fumes from most acids are poisonous. Those who come close enough to
a large body of acid to dunk a creature in it must make an Average (+0)
Endurance check or take 1D6 point of damage. All such characters must
make a second Average (+0) Endurance check one minute later or take
another 1D6 point of damage.

Creatures that are immune to acid's caustic properties might still drown
in it if they are totally immersed and need to breathe. For more
details, see **Suffocation**.

## Carrying Capacity

Strength determines how much weight characters can lift and how much any
additional encumbrance slows them down. Characters carrying more than
their Light Load suffer penalties.

**Light Load**: As a light load, a character can life and carry up to
twice their Strength characteristic score in kilograms without any
penalties or difficulties. For example, an average character with a
Strength score of 7 can carry up to 14 kilograms as a light load.

**Medium Load**: A medium load is considered to be twice a character's
light load, or four times their Strength characteristic score in
kilograms. Characters carrying a medium load suffer a DM-1 to all
physically based checks, including skill checks. In addition, they move
at 75% of their base speed. For example, an average character with a
Strength score of 7 can carry up to 28 kilograms as a medium load. Such
a character would suffer a DM-1 on all physical checks, and move at 4.5
meters, or 3 squares, per round.

**Heavy Load**: A heavy load is three times the character's light load,
or six times their Strength characteristic score in kilograms.
Characters can lift up to a heavy load overhead. Characters carrying a
heavy load suffer a DM-2 to all physically based checks, including skill
checks. In addition, they move at 75% of their base speed. For example,
an average character with a Strength score of 7 can lift up to 42
kilograms as a heavy load. Such a character would suffer a DM-2 on all
physical checks, and move at 4.5 meters, or 3 squares, per round.

**Maximum Load**: A character's maximum load is six times that of their
light load, or twelve times their Strength score in kilograms.
Characters can lift up to the maximum load off the ground, but can only
stagger around with it. While overloaded in this way, characters cannot
undertake any other actions, and can only move 1.5 meters, or 1 square,
per round. For example, an average character with a Strength score of 7
can barely lift up to 94 kilograms as a maximum load. Such a character
could perform no other actions while struggling with the load, except to
move 1.5 meters per round.

**Push/Drag**: Characters can push or drag up to five times their heavy
load weight, moving at half their normal speed. Favorable conditions
(smooth ground, dragging a slick object) double these numbers, and bad
circumstances (broken ground, pushing an object that snags) can reduce
them to one-half or less.

### Gravity and Carrying Capacity

The above assumes the character is operating at a standard 1.0 gravity.
When operating under a different gravitational pull (or within an
artificial gravity set to a non-standard value), simply divide a
character's load weight by the gravitational pull to determine the new
load weight value under those conditions.

## Diseases

Diseases reduce a character’s Characteristics, usually Endurance. The
character must make an Endurance check with the listed DM to resist the
effects of the disease. If the character fails the Endurance check then
he takes the listed damage and must make another Endurance check a few
hours or days later, depending on the interval of the disease. Once an
Endurance check has been passed, the character has fought off the
disease.

#### Table: Sample Diseases

| Disease           | DM  | Damage | Interval  |
|-------------------|-----|--------|-----------|
| Pneumonia         | +0  | 1D6+4  | 1D6 weeks |
| Anthrax           | –3  | 1D6+2  | 1D6 days  |
| Regina Flu        | +1  | 1D6–2  | 1D6 days  |
| Biological Weapon | –6  | 1D6+8  | 1D6 hours |

## Extremes of Temperature

Unusually hot or cold worlds can cause damage unless the characters are
suitably protected. Temperatures are in Celsius.

#### Table: Extreme Temperatures

| Temperature | Damage    | Example                  |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Below -200˚ | 3D6/round | Absolute Zero, Pluto     |
| -200˚       | 2D6/round | Liquid nitrogen, Neptune |
| -100˚       | 1D6/round | Ceres                    |
| -50˚        | 2D6/hour  | Mars                     |
| -25˚        | 1D6/hour  | Arctic                   |
| 0˚          | None      | Water melting point      |
| 50˚         | 1D6/hour  | Very hot desert          |
| 100˚        | 2D6/hour  | Water boiling point      |
| 200˚        | 1D6/round | Mercury                  |
| 500˚        | 2D6/round | Venus                    |
| Above 500˚  | 3D6/round | Surface of the sun       |

### Catching on Fire

Characters touching a fire source might find their clothes, hair, or
equipment on fire. Those at risk of catching fire are allowed a
Difficult (-2) Dexterity check to avoid this fate. If a character's
clothes or hair catch fire, he takes 2D6 damage immediately. In each
subsequent round, the burning character must make another Difficult (-2)
Dexterity check. Failure means he takes another 2D6 damage that round.
Success means the fire has gone out.

A character on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by jumping
into enough water to douse himself, spraying himself down with a fire
extinguisher, vent all atmosphere or otherwise smother the flames. If
the character has no such means, rolling on the ground or smothering the
fire with cloaks or the like permits the character a DM+2 on his next
Dexterity check.

## Falling and Gravity

A character who falls on a 1-gravity world suffers 1D6 damage per two
meters fallen. High- or low-gravity worlds will increase or decrease the
damage. Look up the size code for the world and the gravity level
associated with it and multiply the falling damage by the gravity
number.

## Poisons

Poisons operate in the same way as diseases, but generally work much
faster and often have a wider range of effects. Most poisons do not have
an interval but apply their damage immediately.

#### Table: Sample Poisons

| Poison     | DM   | Damage                                       |
|------------|------|----------------------------------------------|
| Arsenic    | –2   | 2D6                                          |
| Tranq Gas  | –1D6 | Unconsciousness if Endurance check is failed |
| Neurotoxin | –4   | 1D6 Intelligence                             |

## Radiation Exposure

Radiation exposure is measured in rads. Once a character has absorbed a
certain number of rads, he will suffer certain effects. One problem with
radiation exposure is that while physical symptoms can be treated and
may heal, the radiation never goes away. The character’s rads must be
tracked. Further exposure adds to what the character is already carrying
around until a deadly level is reached. Accumulated rads can be removed
using anti-radiation drugs. Characters exposed to a radiation weapon
will receive a one-time dose of radiation. Entering a radioactive area
or being exposed to a leak or solar flare will cause exposure each round
or hour. Every time a character experiences exposure to radiation, they
must check to see if they’ve come down with radiation sickness, as
outlined on the Radiation Effects table. The character must make an
Endurance check at the listed DM, and if he fails, he takes the damage
listed and must make another Endurance check after the listed interval
has passed. This cycle continues until the character succeeds at an
Endurance check.

At any Radiation Level below Mild, the character is treated as having a
lower Endurance characteristic score. If a character should accumulate
enough rads to move to a higher Radiation Level, the new Endurance
characteristic score immediately goes into effect. On the other hand, if
a character moves to a lower Radiation Level, such as through
anti-radiation drugs, the character heals the difference between the
former level and the current level over time, as if it were physical
damage. If a character’s Effective endurance falls below zero, the
character goes unconscious and cannot recover until their Radiation
Level drops enough to allow healing to take place.

#### Table: Common Radiation Exposure Sources

| Situation                       | Instant (rads) | Extended (rads) |
|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Irradiated area, low level      | --             | 1D6/hour        |
| Irradiated area, moderate level | --             | 2D6/hour        |
| Irradiated area, high level     | --             | 6D6/hour        |
| Irradiated area, severe level   | --             | 12D6/hour       |
| Active exposure, low level      | 3D6            | 3D6x10/hour     |
| Active exposure, moderate level | 1D6x10         | 1D6x100/hour    |
| Active exposure, high level     | 2D6x10         | 2D6x100/hour    |
| Active exposure, severe level   | 4D6x10         | 3D6x100/hour    |

#### Table: Radiation Effects

| Radiation Level | Rads    | Effective Endurance | DM   | Damage | Interval  |
|-----------------|---------|---------------------|------|--------|-----------|
| Mild            | &lt;100 | --                  | None | None   | None      |
| Low             | 100-199 | Endurance-1         | +1   | 1D6    | 1D6 weeks |
| Moderate        | 200-599 | Endurance-3         | +0   | 1D6+2  | 2D6 days  |
| High            | 600-999 | Endurance-6         | -1   | 1D6+4  | 1D6 days  |
| Severe          | 1000+   | Endurance-10        | -2   | 1D6+6  | 1D6 hours |

## Starvation and Dehydration

Characters might find themselves without food or water and with no means
to obtain them. In normal climates, a character needs at least a gallon
of fluids and about a pound of food per day to avoid starvation. In very
hot climates, characters need two or three times as much water to avoid
dehydration.

A character can go without water for a number of hours equal to 20 plus
twice his Endurance score. After this time, the character must make a
Routine (+2) Endurance check each hour (DM-1 for each previous check) or
take 1D6 damage.

A character can go without food for 3 days, in growing discomfort. After
this time, the character must make a Routine (+2) Endurance check each
day (DM-1 for each previous check) or take 1D6 damage.

Damage from thirst or starvation cannot be recovered until the character
gets food or water.

## Suffocation

In an area where sufficient oxygen is not long available, such as on
board a starship without life support, a character begins to suffocate,
suffering 1D6 damage each minute. A character who is utterly without air
(such as one who is being smothered or strangled, or who has been dumped
out an airlock) suffers 1D6 damage each round instead.

## Vacuum Exposure

Beings exposed to the airless cold of space are not immediately doomed.
Contrary to popular belief, characters exposed to vacuum do not
immediately freeze or explode, and their blood does not boil in their
veins. While space is very cold, heat does not transfer away from a body
that quickly. The real danger comes from suffocation and ionizing
radiation.

On the third round of exposure to vacuum, a character must succeed on a
Very Difficult (-4) Endurance check each round or suffer from
aeroembolism ("the bends"). A character that fails the check experiences
excruciating pain as small air bubbles form in its bloodstream; such a
character is considered stunned and generally unable to move, and
remains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure. A character
that fails the check with an Exceptional Failure (Effect -6 or lower)
falls unconscious.

The real danger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though holding one's
breath in vacuum damages the lungs. Treat anyone trapped in a hard
vacuum as being utterly without air under the **Suffocation** rules.

Unfiltered radiation bombards any character trapped in the vacuum of
space without protective gear. A character exposed to this ionizing
radiation suffers from severe sunburn as well as the effects equivalent
to a high level irradiated area. See **Radiation Exposure** for specific
details.

## Weather

Driving wind, rain, snowstorms and so forth give a –1 DM to ranged
attacks from poor visibility and a –1 DM to ranged attacks from
environmental interference. Sensors can be used to avoid the visibility
penalty. Extremely high winds and torrential rain can inflict a negative
Dice Modifier of –1 to –4 to all skill checks.
